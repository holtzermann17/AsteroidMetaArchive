How about creating a page that lists in addition to
the Latest Additions and Latest Revisions, Latest
Corrections and Latest Postings (i.e., in these
two cases, a list of
the *objects* that have been corrected or posted
to, as with the first two cases), all in one
easy-to-access place? Then people will know where
the action is! 

(Furthermore, it would be interesting to see how --
in a system that allowed users to freely create
"meta-level" topic-discussions, the conversation
would move from some somewhat off-topic place
to the central location for discussing whatever
topic it was people were actually thinking about.)

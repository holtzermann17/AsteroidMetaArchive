This page is supposed to do the huge job of summing up the various AM projects
and making them appealing to people who might want to get involved.

The Noosphere-based projects form one natural category - and involvement here
could range from content creation, deployment, administration, funding, coming
up with new ideas, adding new features to the code, etc.!  Thus, it is important
that this section begin with an overview of what Noosphere is.  Actually, we
might want at least two such overviews, one technical and one non-technical.

HDM is another category.  This overview can be short, sweet, and NPOV.

The various (even more) fictional projects are a third category.

Finally, AM itself is a fourth category.

How can mass-uploading and other useful programmatic actions on the encyclopedia
can be facilitated in a way that doesn't result in "appropriation" of the PM
system?  Perhaps the right way to go would be to require that entries be
reviewed/certified before entering the encyclopedia (like
[http://www.kuro5hin.org K5] does), this would definitely help. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

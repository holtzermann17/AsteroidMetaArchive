Searching through the Library of Congress for mathematical works published in the Uninted States yielded the following:

 * [[file:Mathematical works published in the U.S. in 1923.org][Mathematical works published in the U.S. in 1923]]

Since this is letting a lot slip through the cracks, I decided to systematically search through call numbers.  Some of the material I found so far listing books which may be in the public domain will be posted here:

This is not meant to be complete.  Later, I will explain more about exactly what this is, but for now take this to be a list of some (not all) math books published before 1963 or with no publication date indicated.

* Question

Can you add links describing the relevant portions of law?  (Or detailed
summaries thereof.)  This is a bit confusing, since it has to do with /old/
copyright law and its interface with /new/ copyright law.

Exacly what is in the public domain is explained on Project Gutenberg.

(Links would still be helpful...) --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]


* Comment
Ray, I just wanted to mention that I think that this project you're undertaking
has quite a lot of promise.  Its exciting to think about what might be
available here.  One thing that this just made me think is that maybe the
LOC should maintain Copyright metadata, that would say if a work was in
the public domain.  Certainly, a field like this could be added to PM's
shared bibliography, when it is created.  Anyway, good job & looking
forward to seeing the final results of the search -- and the eventual
integration of the results into PM -- which could be the topic for a 
whole 'nother grant, and partnerships with people like the folks at
Cornell or elsewhere.  --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

* Improvement

Since the Library of Congress has redone its online catalog, it is now
much easier to obtain the lists of math books published in a given year.
To obtain the list of all books published in the year Y, one may proceed as follows:

1. Browse the url http://catalog.loc.gov/

2. Click on "Basic Search"

3. Click "Set Search Limits"

4. Type Y in "Date" box

5. Click "Set Search Limits"

6. Choose "Command Keyword*" from menu

7. Type "KCLA qa?" in "Search Text" box

8. Choose "100 records per page" from drop-down menu

9. Click "Begin Search"

10. Scroll down to bottom of page

11. Click "All (this page only)" button

12. Choose "MARC (non-Unicode/MARC-8)" from drop-down menu

13. Click "Press to SAVE or PRINT"

14. Save the file

15. Go back a page on browser

16. If there are more pages click on "Next" and repeat steps 10-15

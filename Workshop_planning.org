Aaron and I have been talking about running a Noosphere/Arxana meetup and hackfest.
Likely to occur within the next few months, I think; and at least to me, it seems
to be something of a priority (and fun), since it relates closely to the
[[file:Noosphere documentation.org][Noosphere documentation]] feature request, which is generally agreed to be
pretty important. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Jan 15 06

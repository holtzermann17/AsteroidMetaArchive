The initial published version of the "metacommons manifesto" is at
[[file:metacommons_manifesto.org][metacommons_manifesto]].  I hope this page will be a place to talk
about further ideas along these lines.

After we "finished" the metacommons manifesto,
I wrote some further notes continuing to develop these and other
ideas.  The most important idea here is probably to make the distinction
between "meta-level" activities and other activities smooth instead
of sharp.

Here is a [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2004-04/nsf-htb040604.php link]
to an article about /mapping scientific knowledge/, and a representative quote:

: "Creating a map for all of science will require large-scale
cyberinfrastructure," BÃ¶rner said. "The endeavor will involve
terabytes of data-publications, patents, grants and other
databases -- scalable software and large amounts of number-crunching
power. Such computational effort is common in physics or biology but
not in the social sciences. However, maps of science will benefit
every field."

I don't have the specific links, but some NYU students who presented
at a conference on "/Rethinking the University: Labor, Knowledge,
Value/" showed "maps of labor" around the university.  Very similar to
the notion I've been considering about making "maps of value"
indicating (among other things) "currency currents".

Along these lines, have a look at the 
[http://www.countercartographies.org/ Counter Cartographies Collective].
Basically, this is a group which tries to raise awareness of various
issues by making maps which show such things as flow of labor which are
not usually indicated on maps.
In particular, have a look at their article [http://www.countercartographies.org/component/option,com_docman/Itemid,32/task,doc_details/gid,1/ Drifting through the
Knowledge Machine].

(a) www.countercartographies.org was offline for a while,
but I checked out the paper via the Google cache.

(b) Apparently the U of MN people are already familiar with this
group, see http://www.excotc.org/node/95 for the reference (and other
references).

Here's one of several possible interesting quotes from that paper:

: The 'ivory towers' are used as citadels in the newly conquered
territories of the global economy, dotting our landscapes with
sentinels/centurions of empire.  They must be laid siege to, they must
be infiltrated [...] a proper siege requires blueprints, and
infiltration requires lived experience and adaptation.

It is interesting to compare the "low-budget" activist approach with
the "high-budget" approach required in the /mapping scientific
knowledge/ quote above.

In a sense a corporate "solution" already exists, cf.

(It's interesting to think about what it isn't, too).

* What is "the way of the asteroid" and why is it important

: note - this mini-essay can be revised directly, if you do that,
please add your handle to the list of signatories below.  Separate
discussion is fine too.

Everyone has behavior-governing codes, I don't think there isn't really any way
you can escape them.  This is particularly the case when one is engaged in
social interactions.

The WOA is meant to be completely "philosophy-agnostic" and "POV-agnostic" way
of discussing, re-evaluating, and, if the motivation arises, modifying, these
codes of behavior.  The WOA is really more of a meta-code for than a code.  The
only expectation is that AM [[file:Users.org][Users]] should be willing to participate in some
self-reflection, writing, and discussion, the goal of which is to make each of
us a more effective participant in AM and (if I can be quite general) in our own
lives.  WOA adherents are free to make their own interpretation of the
discussion topics, or add new ones about areas they think need to be studied.

In addition to helping each individual work more effectively, it is my feeling
that WOA participation will facilitate communication that will help Asteroid
authors work more effectively together.  The watchword of the WOA is
explicitness.  The hypothesis is that if you are clear about where you stand and
where you are going, you'll be more likely to get where you want to be.

In a volunteer and/or collectively run organization like !AsteroidMeta,
"personal" and "professional" can blur.  You aren't obliged to talk about
anything private in the WOA: quite the opposite, it is a place to talk about
things that you think can benefit from public discussion.  Those things will
differ from person to person.  But we can't communicate about these things
telepathically.  You are of course free to apply WOA ideas to private matters in
your own time and space if you wish.

It is an express goal of the WOA to be sufficiently meta-level to apply to
anyone.  Furthermore, there are certain organizational matters that have been
made a part of the WOA, for example, the [[file:Budget.org][Budget]].  The first reason for this
is that these organizational things require clear thinking and ongoing revision,
which is what the WOA is about.  The second reason is that budgetary matters
(for example) tie into "personal" matters like motivation, time-commitment,
interests, and outside sources of income.  To the extent that our organizational
machinations "click" with the personal-but-public goals and strategies spelled
out by individual participants, we can assume that our organization is serving
everyone well.

The important thing about the WOA is to describe how you operate in terms that
will help others work well with you, and help you clarify to yourself your own
strategies for success, and to do these things again at the level of the
organization.  Too much discussion like this and it would be overkill.  Not
enough, and we will have a much harder time getting anything done.

Please use WOA to shed some light on this dark rock we call "AsteroidMeta" and
to share some your goals, strategies, and aspects of your personal growth with
other AM users.  --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Thu May 05 15:41:54 2005 UTC (based on

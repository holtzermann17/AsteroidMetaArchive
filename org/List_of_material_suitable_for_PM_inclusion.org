The aim of this page is to create a list of material that is 'in queue'
for being imported into PM. There are still issues to resolve. However, when these 
are resolved, we will need suitable content.

See also [[file:finding new content for PM.org][finding new content for PM]], [[file:Copyright renewals for math books.org][Copyright renewals for math books]].

**  Candidates

 * Steve Cheng (user stevecheng on PM) has released the following text under the FDL[http://gold-saucer.afraid.org/math/]: Lebesgue Integral and Measure Theory (54 pp.).

 * Sean Mauch, Introduction to Methods of Applied Mathematics,
[http://www.acm.caltech.edu/~seanm/] See disucssion at [[file:finding new content for PM.org][finding new content for PM]].

 *  Hyperbolic Functions by James McMahon, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13692]
It is written in short "Articles" and would not require too much editing.

* One Person's Opinion

There are three important priorities for 
PlanetMath Inc. (as I see things):

 * Trusteeship of core assets
 * Continual enhancement of core assets
 * Sound financial footing.

These are intertwined. 

By "trusteeship" I refer to the safeguarding
and preservation of the assets of the
organization, which include the PM entries
created by volunteers as well as the software,
hardware, bank account, and good name of Planet 
Math.

"Continual enhancement" may be seen as a
necessary part of trusteeship and refers to
ongoing improvements and adaptations so that
PlanetMath succeeds in the long run.

"Sound financial footing" is also part of the
trusteeship and means that the organization's
necessary infrastructure is securely funded for
posterity and not excessively vulnerable to
the whims of others. This means in part,
not being dependent upon donated rent,
bandwidth, hardware and systems engineering
services.

Hey Zymeth, welcome.  I've been thinking that until PlanetPhysics and the other new planets are running stably, maybe we should just add content here on the wiki that can be moved there later.  If you're interested, see [[file:content for new planets.org][content for new planets]].  Anyway, have fun on the Asteroid. Thanks for signing in. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

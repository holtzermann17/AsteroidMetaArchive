Links to pages for tasks related to the [[file:Projects.org][Projects]] we're talking about on this
wiki should be posted here.  If you are working on a task, link to it from your
[http://oddwiki.taoriver.net/wiki.pl/AsteroidMeta/Users user page] and link to yourself from the task here.  If you know
what you're doing and you think it is /worth/ doing, feel free to reclassify
the tasks as appropriate (i.e. move them to below a different project heading).
If you finish a task, move the link to the [[file:Case Closed.org][Case Closed]] page (or mark as /case closed/ and a !WikiGnome will move it for you at an appropriate time).

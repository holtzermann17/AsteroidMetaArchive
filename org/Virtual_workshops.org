I think it would be nice to talk about the code I've been writing with people
who are interested.  I'm at the point with the HDM parsing system where I think
I could probably benefit from getting some feedback.  Interested people can just
download the code and look at it, if they like - but we could also set up a time
to meet on IRC.  --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Tue Apr 19 22:32:42 2005 UTC

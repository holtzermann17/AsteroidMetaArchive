First, see [[file:PlanetMath Expenditures.org][PlanetMath Expenditures]] -- there may be some category that describes you there!

Second, realize that to get money /from/ !PlanetMath may sometimes require getting money
/for/ !PlanetMath.  While we expect to have some general funds, these are the precisely
the funds that will have the most competition associated with them.  In the case of a
specialized project, you might look for grants that PM could administer and you
could work on -- or even third parties who will pay you directly to do something with the site.

A great point.  PM.org should be seen more as a conduit for the support of a particular family 
of activities,  not a source. --[[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]] Sun Mar 5 00:39:41 UTC 2006

On that note, the people who actually work /for/ PM.org will probably tend to
do a lot of "integrative" work. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

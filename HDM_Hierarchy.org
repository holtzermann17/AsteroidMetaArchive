Of course, all the different components of the [[file:HDM.org][HDM]] relate to each other, but
it is conveninent, when possible, to look at the various pieces as sub, and
sub-sub etc., projects, since this will help us spell out the milestones we need
to complete the system.

Each of the items below is a link to a page that explains that subsystem and its
relation to things below it (and perhaps also across from it or above it) in the
hierarchy.  Some of these pages don't exist yet.

This list can be edited as needed.

The links here can be to pages that are "meta" to the actual projects they
describe (like the [[file:Guide to the HDM.org][Guide to the HDM]] is meta to the HDM project page).

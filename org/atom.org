Generally speaking, an atom is an item of a list which is not itself a list.

In the case of s-expressions, an atom is a string of alphanumeric characters and punctuation marks other than parentheses, periods, semiclolons and quote signs (which have special meaning in LISP).  An s-expression is either an atom or the written representation of a list constructed from such atoms.

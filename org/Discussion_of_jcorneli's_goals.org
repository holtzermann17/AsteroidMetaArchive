First of all, since I can now write useful software, I think
I should be attaching a virtual tip jar to all my sourcecode
postings.

Secondly, I think we should talk about [[file:Honoraria for FEM editors.org][Honoraria for FEM editors]].

Third, I'm beginning to get some more requests for tutoring - which is
apparently the one thing I'm qualified to do besides hack (and write).

Bravo on the tutoring! So your situation looks less dire?

I'm happy to discuss Honoraria.  Those interested, however, need to do legwork
to make these kind of arrangements (and I know of course you are willing).  My focus
 has to be on PM/NS, though.

I wouldn't say non-dire, but yeah, somewhat less dire.

This is a rigorous account of some mathematical theory I have been studying,
a more impressionistic account of which is to be found in my essay 
[[file:Two years later.org][Two years later]].  The introverted name of this essay refers to the
fact that the purpose in assembling this theory was to provide a mathematical
account of some aspects of mathematics, with intended applications to such
topics as repreesentation of mathematical information, knowledge management
for mathematics, and automatic verification of reasoning.

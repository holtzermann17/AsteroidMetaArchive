 1. Is it possible to have directory for library as a config variable

Yes... I've started doing this for the search engine library.  Add a new variable in baseconf.pm and
and example instance and value in baseconf-example.pl.  Then make sure baseconf is loadded before any of these
"use lib" calls to a static location.  --[[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]] Thu Aug 18 19:13:17 UTC 2005

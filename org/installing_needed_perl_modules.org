If you have Perl installed, you can install directly through the CPAN
module, which is like Perl's "own package system".  Run

 perl -MCPAN -e shell

And set up the system.  Then you can search for strings by running a command like "<nowiki>d /xslt/</nowiki>" or "m <nowiki>/Denter/</nowiki>", and then install with the "install".

(You need to have the xml-libxml perl module installed in order for the xslt package to work.)

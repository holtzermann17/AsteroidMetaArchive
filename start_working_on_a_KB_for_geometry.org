We need some hcode encodings of facts about geometry.  Remember that
in addition to definitions, theorems, and proofs, we are going to
want axioms. (Axioms are just privileged definitions, really, I suppose.)
In addition, in the AI component we should have heuristics like "if you
know two angles in a triangle, it might be a good idea to compute
the third one" or whatever.

I'm not sure axioms are really privileged definitions. It's more like they are
implicit definitions. They list (Â¿define?) what properties an object can have,
without having to define the object itself. for instance, in the classical
geometry exposition, point and line aren't defined "a point is..., a line is..."
but rather they're implicitly defined by their properties: a line is something
that always contains two points, which cannot intersect another line in two
points... etc and so axioms define a group of objects altogether in an implicit
way -- [[file:drini.org][drini]] Sat Feb 12 13:10 2005

Good points.  (Bad pun.)  But I'm not clear on how the definitions are supposed
to go.  Perhaps I should sit down with a copy of Euclid and see if I can get
anywhere; at least I'd have an idea about the things we'd want to write up, even
if I didn't have much of a clue about how to write them. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Sat Feb 12 20:45:06 2005

A good place to look for ideas and clarification might be D. Hilbert's "Foundations of Geometry".  In fact, I could think of no better a starting point for formalizing geometry.  As for how axioms can be thought of as implicit definitions, I think Makarov's article will shed some light on that, but I need to study it some more. --[[file:rspuzio.org][rspuzio]]

Some motivation on the topic of formal geometry can be found here:

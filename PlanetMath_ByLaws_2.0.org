* The ByLaws

This section (and this section only) consists of the offical bylaws of 
PlanetMath.org, Ltd.  More specific rules of the organization should be 
considered separate policy.

** Board of Directors


 1. The purpose of the Board of Directors is to oversee the operations of
  the organization, make sure that they are consonant with the mission
  of the organization, and set goals for the organization.  
 1. The board represents the interests of the members and the nonmember
  "stakeholders" of the organization's activities (such as primary or
  secondary mathematics students).
 1. The oversight provided by the board is at a high level, dealing
  with the overall operation.
 1. The board is responsible for setting the organizational budget.    
 1. The board serves as a court of appeals for disputes within the
  organization which cannot be settled by ordinary means and
  investigates complaints of impropriety raised by members or
  employees of the organization.
 1. The board creates and destroys permanent positions within the
  organization. 
 1. The board creates and destroys committees to perform specific tasks
  (be they limited-term or ongoing).
 1. The board approves officers for the organization and reviews the
  performance of officers on an annual basis (and can relieve officers
  of their duties and replace them if it deems that they are not
  carrying out these duties in a manner consonant with the mission of
  the organization).
 1. A quorum of the board is a majority of the board.
 1. The board can create arbitrary operational policy by a majority vote.  
  This policy should be recorded in an officially-posted document.
 1. Board elections take place every other year.  
 1. A board member is automatically a member of the organization.

** Officers and Employees

 1. The officers and employees serve to conduct the day-to-day operations of
  the organization.  While the board sets the agenda in broad terms,
  it is the officers who implement this agenda, deciding how it is to
  be carried out and setting up subagendas and subgoals for that purpose.
 1. The President is also Executive Director and supervises the activities of the 
  other officers and ad hoc and non-officer ongoing hires.  The President
  has full discretion over hiring of non-officers, unless the board sets
  forth special policy dictating otherwise.
 1. For accountability, there will be at least annual reports to the board, which 
  will be also available publicly to the members.  The reports will be
  coordinated by the President, who can delegate portions to other officers.
 1. The officers are to be responsive to the needs to the community and
  their requests.  Officers should engage in and encourage discussion 
  within the community.

** Membership

 1. There are three ways one can become eligible to be member of the organization:
## Working Member --- Someone who has contributed at least 1000 points 
   to the PlanetMath.org web site, or who has contributed code to the codebase.
## Paying Member --- Someone who has donated at least $20 to the organization 
   within the last year.
## Board Member --- Someone who has been elected to the Board.
 1. Powers of Members:
## Members may propose
  board nominees but board members or officers may also nominate themselves or 
  other parties.
## Members ratify changes in the bylaws.
## Members vote on formal referenda.

** Board Meetings

 1. Official meetings shall take place quarterly at a time and date
  and venue set by the board with at least two week's public notice.
 1. Unless otherwise stated, board meetings shall be open to members.

(officially adopted, 11/5/08)

* Organizational Goals

Our goals as an organization and community are:

 1. to create free educational content in mathematics 
 1. to advocate for and support the study of mathematics
 1. to improve the uptake, accessibility, and propagation of mathematical knowledge
 1. to foster commons-based peer production (CBPP) of knowledge content

(officially adopted, 11/5/08)

*  Supporting Policy

Other guidelines (not official) 

** Operating Principles of the Organization

This section describes how we generally (not specifically) plan to bring the above goals about.

To do our work we plan to:

 1. structure our efforts in a chiefly volunteer/collaborative/CBPP manner
 1. employ choice and diversity over control and uniformity
 1. undertake research and development on collaborative systems
 1. do outreach in the mathematical communities about the goals
 1. get people into using CBPP systems (Noosphere and beyond),
variously: in new areas, as a way of taking over areas of "centrally" produced
knowledge, and also in ways are directly compatible with traditional methods
of knowledge production 
 1. provide a sustainable organizational shell to accodmodate the community and steward development activities
 1. forge partnerships with organizations with overlapping interests
 1. pursue all compatible forms of support at all levels, from grassroots to official organizations

** Community and Organizational Philosophy

The philosophy of our community, and hence our organization, is that
the individual or group should be free to do whatever they want as
long as it does not destructively interfere with the commons (our
shared resources and spaces).  When there is a question as to whether
the commons is likely to be significantly altered, the general
community should be engaged in discussion.  The nonprofit, its
officers, and the board shall be the arbiters and stewards of the
general community's interest in the commons.

Ultimately, community members are responsible for maintaining the
nonprofit (e.g. with contributed work effort whether for pay or not,
monetary donations, and voiced opinions, e.g., in board elections or
polls).

It is highly desirable that procedures be put in place whereby
community pre-approval can be secured before a given action is taken.
This will save work and possibly avert disaster.  However, if some
action or activity has significantly perturbed or altered the nature
of the commons, we should have a protocol in place whereby the
community may, after due deliberation, "roll back" changes that are
not confluent with the organization's goals.

The philosophy of freedom to act in a non-distructive fashion is the
essence of "commons-based peer production", wherein most resources are
brought to the table by motivated individuals on a volunteer basis, so
individuals are free to make use of the intangible products of the
collaborative project in an unlimited, nonrival manner.  When aspects
of the commons itself are called into question, some political process
is needed.  In our case, we choose a mixture of direct and
representative democracy.

Our organizational structure should reflect this philosophy
throughout.  In other words, as we spell out in functional detail the
interface between an arbitrary community member, the wider community,
and the official organization, we will continue to turn to this
philosophy as a guiding principle.

** Petitioning Policy

In addition to carrying out planned activities, the organization can react to
ad hoc situations through /petitioning/.  As a general guideline, the organization
should be petitioned in any case a community member or members thinks their actions
(or those of another) will significantly alter the nature of the commons.  

We define "commons" in this context to specifically mean the shared resources of the
community and that which the organization directly supervises, including, but not
limited to:

 * the "meta" materials of the web site (documentation pages, etc.)
 * the server or other facilities of the web site
 * the overall kind or balance of content on the site
 * the functionality of the web site (i.e. the Noosphere software itself)
 * the planning wiki, especially sections marked "official"

Petitioning should proceed logically up the "chain" of command: to the specific officer
supervising the aspect of the commons in question, then to the executive (the president),
then to the board itself.  

The petitioned officer will then decide (possibly in congress with other officers or the
board) if the issue merits a different course of action or wider input in order to reach a
decision.  

If more input is deemed necessary, generally one of three courses of action will be taken:

 1. informal commentary will be solicited on some public forum (such as the PM.org discussion board on
the web site) and the official(s) at the petitioned level or above will make a decision based on the 
feedback.
 1. a poll will be conducted of web site users and used to advise the decision-making as above.
 1. a referendum will be conducted amongst the organization's members and action will be binding
based on the outcome.

Which course of action is taken is at the discretion of the managment (and ultimately the
board).

Conversely, the officers of the organization may step in directly to initiate the 
above process if they feel there is some need to re-evaluate an activity taking place
or which has already taken place that has altered the commons.

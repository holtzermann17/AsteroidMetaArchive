** About
Hi, I'm called Leno. I study physics at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm Sweden. I'm interested in math parsing, h-code and generally anything to do with !LaTeX. ;)

See [[file:Parsing_natural_math.org][Parsing_natural_math]] for my proposal.

Hi Leno.  If you're interested in applying for a !SoC project, we had better hurry and come up with something.  
If you're just generally interested... that's OK too!  --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

Yeah, i've updated my !SoC submission; hope that's what you were reffering to. --[[file:Leno.org][Leno]]

Can anyone get in touch with this guy?  Not enough info here for me to find his email. --[[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]]

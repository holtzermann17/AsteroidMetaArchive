The AI sub-system is supposed to take care of everything "about math"
that isn't dealt with by the formal system.  These issues include:

 * issues of "quality", particularly as relevant to proof heuristics;
 * information about the "real world" and the "informal" thinking of human 
mathematicians; 
 * drivers for all of the system's components.

(For now, both HCI and AI work have been largely subsumed in one
branch of the project, namely [[file:Arxana.org][Arxana]].)

* References

One particularly interesting /historical/ reference is Douglas
[[file:Lenat's AM.org][Lenat's AM]].  It would be useful to have a program on hand that can
do similar things.

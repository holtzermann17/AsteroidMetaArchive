* What is AsteroidMeta?

This Wiki!  See the [[file:HomePage.org][HomePage]] for an overview of the site.  The purpose of
this project is to serve as a hub for people interested in Free Content.  We aim to
sketch out the resources that are available and provide information on who is
doing what.  We would like to help members of the community connect with tasks
that they would be interested in working on, and help give them the skills to
carry out these tasks.

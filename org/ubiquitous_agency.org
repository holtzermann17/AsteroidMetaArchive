Along with [[file:ubiquitous subjectivity.org][ubiquitous subjectivity]], one might expect to find
/ubiquitous agency/.  The will of the people.

However!!  It may be much more useful to do away with the notion
of "agency" altogether.  Why do we need that hypothesis? 
Perhaps we should invent a language without agency (much as one might
wish to seek a language without gender or race bias).

Indeed, unless presented with some further evidence, "agency"
/sounds/ like a positively archaic idea, right up there with humors
and spirits and inate natures.

Better I think to study actual dynamics of thought, action, and the world.

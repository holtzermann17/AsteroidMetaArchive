When using 'sub eimmexp.cmd' I get a bug message. It corresponds to nothing since the result is good. Perhaps you should remove it Norm. -- [[file:fl.org][fl]] 22-Dec-2006

I don't know what you mean.  I tried it and don't get a bug message.
You'll have to give more details. -- [[file:norm.org][norm]]

I get a BUG #1521 but I've just realized that I'm using the 0.07.24 version (25-Sept-2006) and that there is a new version. It's perhaps the reason. I'll install the new release. -- [[file:fl.org][fl]]

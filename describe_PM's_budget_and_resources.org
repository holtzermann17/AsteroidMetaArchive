The page [[file:PlanetMath Budget and Resources.org][PlanetMath Budget and Resources]] needs to work done on it by someone
who knows the answers to the basic questions ([[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]]).  After the
grundlagen phase, the page can be maintained more and more by the community.

(I'm willing to help with the early phase if I can) --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

Thanks Aaron, looks good.  I'll give it a little light editing and post back
here if I have any specific feedback/additional questions.  --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

It might be a good idea to add information about the amount of traffic the site
has had on this page, and to link to it from the "donate" page on PM.  People
may want to donate when the realize how little money PM actually has taken in --
and (once the page has been fleshed out further) -- how expensive it will be to
do various worthwhile things. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

These are the talking points I dealt with in [[file:January 10 LispNYC Talk|my LispNYC talk.org][January 10 LispNYC Talk|my LispNYC talk]].
The only one I feel very shakey on right now is the last
one; explaining what [[file:arxana.org][arxana]] is in terms of math is
easier than explaining what it is in terms of philosophy,
technology, and magic.  But magic isn't very popular
these days.  

Note, there are presumably many connections of
the points from this talk to things in [[file:The HDM Manifesto.org][The HDM Manifesto]].

 * Make the computer into a mathematician.
 * Ideas are free as in freedom.
 * Information is only as available as it is easy to find.
 * Knowledge is only as easy to obtain as it is to apply.
 * Mathematics is mostly formal and contains metamathematics.
 * Computers are designed for things like the HDM project!
 * People provide intuition and multiple perspectives.
 * Scholia are like K'nex for the mind.
 * Meaning is a property of networks.
 * Links stitch nodes together.
 * Artificial intelligence and hypertext are two sides of one coin.
 * Postmodern documents facilitate creative relationships.
 * Evolution trumps canonicalism.
 * Many perspectives, uses, and reuses, can function simultaneously.
 * Consistency conditions are a social contract ("freedom's price").
 * Documents are built out of atomic pieces (quintuplets).
 * Metadata articles are owned by the system and maintain consistency.
 * Masks are basic consistency maintainers.
 * Version management can be done several different ways.
 * Refactoring is a basic operation.
 * Hcode: how do mathematicians write mathematics?
 * Parsing: how do mathematicians communicate? (help wanted!)
 * Proof checking: how do mathematicians prove things?
 * Metasystems justify rules of inference.
 * A more friendly theorem prover is a goal.
 * As the project progresses, the computer takes a more active role.
 * Arxana is black magic for good people.

One useful feature of a [[file:bidi system.org][bidi system]] is that it can automatically
keep track of the [[file:FDL.org][FDL]] History requirements.  Please note
that the instructions given on the Wikipedia article discussing
their porting project do not seem to adequately conform to 
FDL requirements (see the Quick Links section of
[[file:Wikipedia-PlanetMath Content Exchange.org][Wikipedia-PlanetMath Content Exchange]] for a link to the aforementioned article).

We need to make sure that whatever system we do build actually adheres
to the requirements of the license(s) we're using.  Moreover, someone
should make sure that any by-hand porting efforts that are taking
place at present are not violating the GFDL, lest we end up with a
terrible mess, having to throw away work, etc.

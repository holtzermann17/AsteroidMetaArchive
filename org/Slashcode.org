This page is to lay out things we can learn from the implementation of Slashcode since it is of the same genetic code as Noosphere.

* Configuration

Straight from the beginning of the INSTALL file

" You cannot have different versions of the Slash modules installed
  for different sites on the same Apache server. Well, if you want to,
  you can try the Apache::PerlVINC module, but this is not recommended
  for performance reasons. Slash is designed to have one shared core
  of code for all Slash sites on a system. (This is made easier than
  it was in 1.0.x, where to customize a site, you needed to change the
  module code; this should no longer be necessary.
"

Two big lessons might be learned here

 * We should abstract configuration outside module code
 * If above doesn't fix multiple instances, than something along the lines of vinstall is our only option if we stick with mod_perl

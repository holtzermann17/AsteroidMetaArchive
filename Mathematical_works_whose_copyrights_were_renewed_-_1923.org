/Note: I have tried to err on the side of safety by including some books which may not be strictly mathematical.  However, there is definitely the possibility that I may have missed a few book either as an oversight or because it was not obvious from the title that the book was mathematical in nature.  This is all the more reason why simply examining this list is not sufficient to guarantee that a book is in the public domain./

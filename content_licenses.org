There's been a lot of talk on this wiki (and around the world)
about different kinds of content licenses.  This page is going
to attempt to at least index the disussions that have taken place
locally (probably with some additional but minimal narration). 

Of course, content licenses are meaningless without copyright.  For
more information on copyright, see [[file:copyright concerns.org][copyright concerns]]
(for a start anyway).

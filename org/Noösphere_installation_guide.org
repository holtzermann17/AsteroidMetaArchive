Copied (and slightly edited) from the Noosphere package, Aaron I assume it is OK
with you if I put this under the FDL?  That would be something you could put
into the README file, i.e., you could say that this document and any other
documentation included in the release is available under the FDL. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

This guide is valid as of 2003-08-27.

* Section 1 : Prerequisites

You'll need the following programs and modules to run Noosphere (Debian 
packages given in parens, for those who run Debian, if available):

 * !PostgreSQL 7.2.1 or better (postgresql, postgresql-client) or 
!MySQL 3.2 series or better (mysql-client, mysql-common, mysql-server)
 * Apache 1.3 series (apache, apache-common)
 * mod_perl optional, but recommended (libapache-mod-perl)
 * perl 5.6 or better, and the following perl modules:
  * DBI (libdbi-perl)
  * DBI postgresql driver (libdbd-pg-perl) or
   DBI mysql driver (libdbd-mysql-perl)
  * Apache (comes with libapache-mod-perl)
  * XML::!LibXML (libxml-libxml-perl)
  * XML::!LibXSLT (libxml-libxslt-perl)
  * XML::DOM (libxml-dom-perl)
  * Unicode::String (libunicode-string-perl)
  * Digest::SHA1 (libdigest-sha1-perl) 
  * Data::Denter 
 * vim 6.0 or better (vim)
 * ispell (ispell)
  * a dictionary such as American English (iamerican)
 * wget (wget)
 * tidy (from w3c) (tidy)
 * ghostscript (gs or gs-aladdin)
 * pbm utils (netpbm)
 * !LaTeX2e (tetex-base, tetex-bin)
 * latex2html release 2002-2, see special instructions below
 * !ImageMagick 5 (libs and dev) or later (libmagick5, libmagick5-dev)

** Notes
 * perl 5.8 or better is recommended due to improved Unicode support.
 * vim is used for the syntax-highlighted source view.  Vim is only run in batch
mode, this is not an attempt to switch EMACS-freaks over to the "dark side" !!


* Section 2 : Installation Procedure


1. Install the prerequisites (except latex2html, unless you've already got it,
in which case you should upgrade if its not 2002-2)

2. Go to the directory above where you want Noosphere to live.  Untar 
the Noosphere archive:

  tar -zxvf noosphere-VERSION.tar.gz

You may want to move or symlink the created directory to just "noosphere"
or something like "ns".  This directory will henceforth be referred to as 
$NSROOT.

3. Create a database and database user for Noosphere.  These can be named  
however you like, since you will just configure them later for Noosphere,
but for this installation guide we will refer to them as $NSDB and $NSUSER.

Please refer to the postgresql documentation on how to do this if you are
not familiar with the procedure.

: It would be swell to have the details spelled out here.  Also, the above
should reference the mysql literature too.  --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Tue Mar 01 20:53:15 2005 UTC

4a. Initialize the database for Noosphere:

  cd $NSROOT/db
  psql -W -U $NSUSER $NSDB < schema.pg.sql 
         
or
          
  mysql -u$NSUSER -p $NSDB < schema.mysql.sql

You also need to get some start-up data into the system; in particular a
root user and some forums.  Edit $NSROOT/db/init.sql to your 
liking, and then issue

  psql -W -U $NSUSER $NSDB < init.sql

or 

  mysql -u$NSUSER -p $NSDB < init.sql

4b. Load MSC (Mathematics Subject Classification scheme) category data if  
you have classification support turned on and want this scheme.  Issue a
command like the one above for your DBMS, but for msc.sql.

5a. For latex2html, use the following configure procedure:

  GS=$NSROOT/bin/gs ./configure

or

  ./configure --with-gs=$NSROOT/bin/gs

If you've already installed latex2html, then edit the "pstoimg" script so
that $GS is set to the $NSROOT/bin/gs.  This wrapper is necessary
to do some low-level post-processing.

5b. Make the latex2html programs:

  make

5c. Install latex2html:

  make install

5d. Patch latex2html for Noosphere:

  patch latex2html < $NSROOT/install/patch-latex2html-2002-2

Also patch some other l2h modules:

  patch -p0 < $NSROOT/install/patch-latex2html-2002-2-math.pl
  patch /usr/local/share/lib/latex2html/styles/babel.perl < $NSROOT/install/patch-latex2html-2002-2-styles

5e. Install patched latex2html locally for Noosphere:

  cp latex2html $NSROOT/bin

5f. For Russian support patch latex2html style files:

  cd $L2HDIR/styles 
  patch < $NSROOT/install/patch-latex2html-2002-2-styles

$L2HDIR will probably be something like /usr/share/latex2html.  For me it
was /usr/local/share/lib/latex2html.

6. Get and build the search engine (ESSEX):

Make a directory you want ESSEX to live in, lets call it $ESSEX, and 
cd to it.

  wget http://br.endernet.org/~akrowne/elaine/essex/release/essex-latest.tar.gz

(or similar).   Customize $ESSEX/server/config.h (it is safe to leave the
default values).  Then make:

  cd $ESSEX/server
  ./make

7. Build the page image hyperlink mapper:

  cd $NSROOT/bin/map
  make

8. Make sure the "data" working directories are writeable by the user that 
Noosphere is running as:

  chgrp -R www-data $NSROOT/data/cache
  chmod -R g+sw $NSROOT/data/cache

  chgrp -R www-data $NSROOT/data/cache
  chmod -R g+sw $NSROOT/data/cache


9. Install the background tasks needed by Noosphere.  Lines similar to the 
following should be added to the crontab of the user Noosphere is running
as:

  */10 * * * * $NSROOT/bin/renderall >/dev/null
  */5 * * * * $NSROOT/bin/cleansearchresults >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
  37 * * * * $NSROOT/bin/outstandingcor >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
  00 8 * * * $NSROOT/bin/cleantemp >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
  45 * * * * $NSROOT/bin/spelld_rehash.sh

The "cleantemp" script itself must be changed to point to

  $NSROOT/data/cache/temp

10. Set one-time tasks to initialize at system startup.  Inspect the file 

  $NSROOT/bin/init.sh 

You will need to make changes to this file in terms of paths, and probably
want to put it in one of your /etc/init.d/ (or similar, depending on your
distribution) scripts.

11. Install vim color syntaxing script:

  cp $NSROOT/stemplates/pm.vim /usr/share/vim/vim61/colors/

(or similar)

And that should be it!

* Section 3 : Configuration

For configuration, please direct your attention to (in this order):

** $NSROOT/etc/httpd-example.conf

This is a sample of an Apache/modperl setup for Noosphere (the one that is
used at PlanetMath).  It would be included in the main Apache httpd.conf 
with a line like:

Include /var/www/noosphere/etc/httpd-example.conf

You probably want to rename it to something more meaningful to your own 
project, and tool around with the values therein.  You do not need this 
many virtual hosts, so it is safe to pare down the configuration to a 
single virtualhost which has the mod_perl interface.

The _SITE variables are not restricted to just being domain names, they
can have paths, for example IMAGE_SITE could be "foo.com/~bar/images".

Of course, the directories will all need to be changed to conform to your
own $NSROOT.

** $NSROOT/etc/essex.conf.example

This configures the search engine.   You'll have to change the paths in 
this file to point to $NSROOT/bin. 

Also edit $NSROOT/bin/start_searchengine.sh to point to the 
location of your ESSEX excutable (i.e. $ESSEX/server).

** $NSROOT/lib/Noosphere/baseconf-example.pm

Copy this to baseconf.pm in the same dir, and edit that.

This is the lowest-level config for Noosphere.  In here you will need to
set BASE_DIR to $NSROOT as well as enter in your database configuration.

IMPORTANT: You must set a value for the "HASH_SECRET" constant in this 
file.  This will be used for security purposes.  You can use any source 
you'd like to generate this string, but it should be as random as 
possible.  

Also here, select whether you have support for classification schemes.

** $NSROOT/lib/Noosphere/Config.pm

This is where most of the logic-level (as opposed to presentation-level)
configuration is done.  There is a lot in here, but most of what really 
needs to be changed is near the top.

The part you'll have to think hardest about are the entry types, since the
ones in there are geared towards mathematics in specific.  

* $NSROOT/stemplates/

(Suggested) 

These templates are what PlanetMath uses.  I imagine that some people will
want their own look-and-feel, as not much thought or time went into the 
graphic design of PlanetMath.  Be aware that the actual names of the 
template files aren't necessarily the most useful or consistent, so if you 
want to make a specific change to some particular page on the site, it may
help to simply grep for some unique string on that page in order to find
the right template file.  If you don't find anything, then you'll probably
have to dig into the code (which contains a fair amount of the form pages 
inline).

Of course, if you dont want to change the look and feel, you can basically
skip this (other than changing the IMG SRC for the site logo icon.)

Some of the first template files you might want to attack:

 * header.html
 * main.html
 * frontpage.xsl
 * mainmenu.xsl
 * about.html
 * feedback.html

Note: the templates situation is pretty awful now, as the evolution from
HTML templates to XSL templates is not complete, and CSS is not heavily 
used.  Hopefully this will be fixed at some point in the future 
( volunteers? =) )

** $NSROOT/lib/Noosphere/Layout.pm

(Suggested)

Since the codebase has not yet been entirely XSLT-ized, this perl 
module is still needed.  It contains some presentation-layer routines that
you probably want to modify if you are changing the global colourscheme or
motif.  In the future this should be CSS-ized, then eliminated when it is
XSLT-ized.

Hopefully this will all be changing extensively soon, as more of the math (and
PlanetMath) specific parts of Noosphere are pulled out of the core system and
made into explicit configuration.

* Section 4 : Starting Up

1. Start up the search engine and other miscellaneous Noosphere services.  As
root, run

  $NSROOT/bin/init.sh

2. Start up apache with your Noosphere instance added to the configuration, as 
above.  

  apachectl restart

And you should be in business, with no hitches whatsoever! (yeah right)

* Section 5 : Getting Help

If something goes wrong, drop me a note at akrowne@vt.edu.

For instant gratification, you should log on to IRC.   Help can be found in
#planetmath, on server br.endernet.org or dominia.endernet.org.

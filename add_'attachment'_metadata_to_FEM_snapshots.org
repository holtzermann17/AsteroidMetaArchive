This request may be deceptively titled.  The point is that we need to organize
the structure of each section.  Right now, we sometimes see proofs coming before
theorems, and other weird things like that.

Perhaps "attachment" metadata could be used to help sort things out.  It may or
may not be sufficient.  More than likely some attachments are not in the same
MSC as the things they are attached to, so trying to use attachment metadata
could result in a big mess.

The only other thing I can think of right now is to sit down with the list of
entries and organize it by hand.

* mmj2 Directory Structure

The following directories are empty when
downloaded, and are later created by
running javac (compiler) and javadoc
(creates html documentation):

c:\mmj2\classes

c:\mmj2\doc\mmj

c:\mmj2\doc\resources

c:\mmj2\doc\src-html



** Directories:
(if dest, "c:\mmj2" is changed then
 \windows and \runparm files 
will/may need to be updated.)

* Discussion

Looks reasonable to me, but then again, I haven't seen the code yet :).

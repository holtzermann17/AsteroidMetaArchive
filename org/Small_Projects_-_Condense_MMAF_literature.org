Now that [[file:metamath.org][metamath]] creator/users have joined onto this site, we
have a good chance to ask them questions.  I think it would be handy
for the HDM project to have a metamath and friends (MMAF) quick-start
guide.  Since AFAIK all of the documentation of these programs has been released under the FDL,
we should be able to create this overview/summary document.  Possible
relationships to [[file:hcode.org][hcode]] should be spelled out.

(This discussion will be in the context of PlanetMath, but can easily be ported
to other contexts.)

PlanetMath's homepage currently shows a list of all messages posted
to the site.  Most reasonable people think this is bogus.  What we
need instead is a way to pump certain messages only to the people
who are interested.  This sort of "filter" is a way to break the channel
into several subchannels.

People should be able to introduce sub- and super-channels at will.

E.g. if I am interested in set theory but not ZF theory, I can create
a subchannel that is set theory modulo ZF theory.

If I am interested in some naturally-arising subcommunity, I should be
able to create a subchannel of all messages, namely, those messages
having to do with the given subcommunity.

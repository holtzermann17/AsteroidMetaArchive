* Official Trips

PlanetMath.org official trips; current, past, and future (for items without web pages, 
feel free to create a dedicated page).  Note that meetings listed here have topical and
organizational overlap with other projects, so being listed here is not an exclusive statement
on PM.org "aboutness".  However this page is intended to give PM watchers a single point of 
reference for (physical) meetings.

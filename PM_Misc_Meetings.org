Miscellaneous !PlanetMath meetings (logs, topics discussed, participants, etc).  These may have taken
place on various non-Wiki media.

* Regularly Scheduled Meetings

/(tentative)/ Every 2 weeks by IRC, a governance and general communication meeting.  (We need to decide on an exact schedule, and decide whether this is actually going to happen.)

* Ad Hoc Meetings

See [[file:PlanetMath Ad Hoc Meetings.org][PlanetMath Ad Hoc Meetings]].

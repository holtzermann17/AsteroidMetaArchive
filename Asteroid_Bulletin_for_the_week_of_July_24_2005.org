* Another quiet week

Looking over the "recent changes" page on AsteroidMeta, I don't
see anything very newsworthy.   Apparently the regulars have
been working on "other things" - I for one have been spending
most of my time working on the scholium system.  My latest draft
is available on my homepage, see

I did mention something about how work has been going on the
wiki - in short, its fun and things are coming along!

Ray brought up some comments about things he'd like to see in
the "next" CBPP development platform, and I said that I think
these things will be supported by the scholium system.

So, like I said: its been a quiet week.

See also [[file:Search the forums.org][Search the forums]].  Indeed, it would be good if every different
subcollection could be searched.  Corrections, forums, documentation, books,
papers, etc.!

Note: I also wondered whether the site documentation shouldn't be depreciated in
favor of AM versions of the same thing.  The answer right now is "no", since we
need !LaTeX in PM documentation.  However, I think it would be swell if we could
create new bits and pieces of documentation with the same ease with which new
pages are created on the wiki.  So I would hope that the answer in the future
will be "yes" (assuming that AM is ported into Noosphere at some point).

Here are some general references on non-profit corporations, discussing various 
organizational, financial, and legal issues.


http://www.managementhelp.org/

A rather sizable digital library of information on all sorts of aspects of running 
an organization.   Even includes a mini-MBA program!  This is quite a read (but could
be done a bit at a time, ay one or two of th 675 srticles a day) and I would think that
anyone who goes through it will be pretty well versed on the theoretical side of the 
art of corporate management.

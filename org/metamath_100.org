[http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/ "Formalizing 100 Theorems" by Freek Wiedijk] lists 100 mathematical theorems and the various systems that have formalized a nontrivial number of them.  This list is discussed in [http://www.ams.org/notices/200811/tx081101408p.pdf "Formal Proof - Getting Started" (Freek Wiedijk, Notices of the AMS, Volume 55, Number 11, December 2008)]. Rightly or wrongly, this list is used by others to judge proof systems.  Wiedijk's "getting started" picks as its primary examples HOL Light and Mizar, which at the time had the largest number of proofs.  Similarly, [http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/beeson/Masters/KamThesis.pdf "Case Studies in Proof Checking" by Robert C. Kam] says, "Judging by Dr. Wiedijk’s Formalizing 100 Theorems list, which gives an overview of the headway various proof systems have made in mathematics, Coq and Mizar are two of the most successful systems in use today (Wiedijk, 2007)".

Currently there are 44 proofs proven by Metamath from this list of 100 (including #68, "Sum of an arithmetic series", per the notes below).   As of 2014-02-28 this number of proofs is more than NuPRL/MetaPRL (8), PVS (16), nqthm/ACL2 (18), and ProofPower (42).  However, this is far short of HOL Light (86), Mizar (62), Coq (60), or Isabelle (52). This is still pretty good considering that there had been no concerted effort to prove theorems from this list of 100 until very recently.

Here is the list of the [http://www.metamath.org/ metamath] proofs that are available from this list of 100, along with credit to the individual(s) who created the Metamath formalization. Please add missing entries!

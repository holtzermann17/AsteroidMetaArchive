The code and thesis are [http://www.ma.utexas.edu/~jcorneli/b/Simon/ on my webpage].
The effort was focused on one book whereas HDM is supposed to do all
(math) books, but still, the research shows the basic style of work,
with interplay between several different modules.  The code is some
old dialect of lisp (mixed with prolog) that would probabyl be hard to revive.  The thesis is worth
reading. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

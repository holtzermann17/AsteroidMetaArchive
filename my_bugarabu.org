An African drum, related to the djembe and played similarly.  I have spent several years learning the fine art of African drumming at the hands of my master, Tepaka Sekou Lunda.

In particular, one the drums I played that evening in Roanoke was purchased there at the [[file:Binaba shop.org][Binaba shop]].

Links to pages describing feature requests for the [[file:Projects.org][Projects]] we're talking
about on this wiki should be posted here.  If you're actually working on the
feature request, it should probably be a [[file:Tasks|Task.org][Tasks|Task]].  Once a
feature has been added, move the link to the [[file:Case Closed.org][Case Closed]] page.  If you know
what you're doing and you think it is /worth/ doing, feel free to reclassify
the feature requests as appropriate (i.e. move them to below a different project
heading).

    Metamath source file for elementary symbolic logic using natural
    deduction techniques.

    We begin using words instead of operators, for clarity.
    Later, when everyone is tired of writing out long formulas, 
    we will convert to logical operator symbols.

    The "rules" of natural deduction are presented as theorems
    without Metamath proofs -- initially, the proofs are
    provided in English, with lots of arm waving and examples.

According to me O'Cat to have a natural deduction system you need a context (i.-e. a list of hypotheses ). When the system is designed for, the context can be independant from the formulas but with metamath you have to append it to your formulas. -- [[file:frl.org][frl]] 24-Feb-2006

: Perhaps the term "natural deduction" is often taken as "Gentzen" or
"sequent calculus"? Should I change the wording to make it clear
that this is a "Natural Deduction" system transported into 
a Hilbert-style system (i.e. Metamath) without use of Contexts?
--[[file:ocat.org][ocat]]

:: But your system can't work. There is absolutely no axiom. Try to prove `( ph -> ( ps -> ph ) )'
for instance and you will soon experience a big problem. According to me you can transport an 
Hilbert-style system into a Gentzen-style system but not the contrary. -- [[file:frl.org][frl]] 24-Feb-2006

#+BEGIN_VERSE You make a stunningly good point! I am reminded of the old saying,
"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear." The intent of 
this file is pedagogical, and it is not a final version. With the
file as intended, inferences can be made from hypotheses and students
can become familiar with using the rules. Later, the axioms and
definitions can be copied from set.mm -- for advanced students :)
In the meantime, a given set of hypotheses can be regarded as a
"context", eh? So once the students are familiar with what can be
done with a set of hypotheses, it should be easy to make the switch
from a list of hypotheses to a *set* of given assertions. --[[file:ocat.org][ocat]]

Given the number of things we are trying to do with PlanetMath
(see e.g. [[file:Detailed_PM_whitepaper_outline.org][Detailed_PM_whitepaper_outline]]), I wonder
whether the name "!PlanetMath" might be too artificially limiting.

The issue of /scope/ seems sort of tricky.  While we're talking about Planet/Math/, we
are also developers of at least one much broader tool (i.e. [[file:Noosphere.org][Noosphere]]), and have various
other technical "affiliates" (PlanetPhysics and PlanetComputing), with more hoped for.
In addition, at /AM/, we have a little digital library & hypertext research institute
going on with things like [[file:Arxana.org][Arxana]] having potential for entirely /non/-technical
application.

All of this stuff can certainly go under the PM "label" for now (with
full disclosure), but we may want to consider re-branding ourselves later...

(Note: this is psychically related to [[file:Renaming_the_Noosphere_Encyclopedia_Section.org][Renaming_the_Noosphere_Encyclopedia_Section]].)

Well we can call the whitepaper whatever we want, as long as we make clear what the projects
we are "covering" are.

Careful though, PM is starting to have some "brand recognition." When you get that, it is 
wise to use it.  --[[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]] Tue Feb 14 20:44:27 UTC 2006

Well, we could use it -- and have something else going simultaneously.
(Ray had mentioned "Noosphere Foundation" and something like that
could work.) --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

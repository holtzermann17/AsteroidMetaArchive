We start by showing that if $R$ is a locally cyclic ring then one of the following 
two options must hold:

 * For every $x \in R$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$ such that
$nx = 0$.

 * For every $x \in R$, if $nx = 0$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$,
then $x = 0$.

In other words, it is not possible to have both elements of finite order and infinite
order in the same locally cyclic ring.  (Here, "order of an element" means the order
of the additive group generated by that element.)

Suppose that $kx = 0$ for some $x \in R$ and some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that 
$k \neq 0$.  Further, suppose that $y$ is any element of $R$.  Then, by the definition
of local cyclicity, there must exist $z \in R$ and $m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
$x = mz$ and $y = nz$.  Set $h = km$.  Then we have $h \neq 0$ and 
$hy = (km)(nz) = (nk)(mz) = n(kx) = 0$.

Thus if, for one element $x$ of a locally cyclic ring we have a non-zero integer $k$ 
such that $kx = 0$, for every element $y$ of that ring there will exist a non-zero
integer $h$ such that $hy = 0$.  Contrapositively if, for one element $x$ of a locally
cylic ring, we have $nx \neq 0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$, then, for
every element $y$ of that ring, we must have $my \neq 0$ for all 
$m \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$.

This result states that locally cyclic rings fall into two classes, for which we may
adopt names from the theory of fields.  We will say that our ring has /finite
characteristic/ if, for every element $x$ of the ring, there exists
$n \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$ 
such that $nx = 0$ and we will say that that our ring has /zero
characteristic/ if, for all $n \in \mathbf{Z} \setminus \{0\}$, we have that $nx = 0$
implies $x = 0$.

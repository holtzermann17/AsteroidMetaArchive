The aim of the present entry is form the basis for a user's guide 
about how to write good PM entries. 
Both in view of content and copyrightwise.

* Choosing topics
If you are a professional mathematician, or a full time student there
is surely small problems that pop up when reading mathematical 
works. These can form an ideal source for good topics for PM entries. 

A few things to keep in mind
 * Avoid too esoteric topics. Changes are, they will be of little use.
 * This is an encyclopaedia and should contain math that is well
  established, not the latest research. 
 * The first draft does not need to be perfect. PM has plenty of users.
  Over time (months, years) the entry will expand. 
 * Currently PM resembles the Cantor set; it is full of holes. 
  These gaps provide an endless source for new entries.

* Copyright issues

** Citing

Keep in mind that under the FDL, the next user might remove all 
citations. 

* When is citing good
 * For a treatment of the case when X is a Banach space, see [1]

* When is citing bad
 * An entry full of citations will be difficult to maintain. 

** Merging entries

** Copying text and pictures from other entries

** Writing entries based on forum discussions

** Writing entries based on an Wikipedia entry

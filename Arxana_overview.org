Talking with Aaron about how to make this work... 

We agreed that separating links out from their source documents is
a good idea (see [[file:Arxana's linking model.org][Arxana's linking model]]) -- he has done this
in other digital library systems before.

And with this insight, most of the rest of the system is easily described...

* Articles

Articles are plunked into the system.  To an approximation, they
look like /(T,L)/, where /T/ is "text" and /L/ are "links"
indicating connections between articles. 

These links are typed, and can accordingly do more powerful things
than the usual HTML link you're familiar with, for example, an
arbitrary part of another article. (Or presumably something else
"computed" from another article or even, possibly, a set of articles,
but for such complicated instances you should see and
think about what's written elsewhere about [[file:Arxana's linking model.org][Arxana's linking model]].)

/T/ might be a list of records, in which
case, a given link /l/ might say /<record i> associates with
<Object alpha>/.  Or /T/ might be plain text, in which case,
instead of identifying a record, one identifies a range of characters
that's supposed to be treated as a "hyperlink".

/L/ might be auto-generated by some process that sits above Arxana.
And of course links can be typed (and are basically a lot like articles,
see the reference I gave above).

Anyway, that's the idea...

* Interlinker

Then when Arxana sees these articles, it has to process them somehow.
One step is to separate out the links on /L/ and create new first-class
objects representing each one, stored in appropriate indexes so that
they can be read both (or more) ways.  

We can get the key features associated with "backlinks" without maintaining
them explicitly this "dynamic" way! However, it may be that there are
some "static" actions that need to be taken at this time. In any event,
the interlinking process should allow functions that are sensitive to
new articles or links to run and modify portions of the database
recursively.

So, that's pretty simple...

* Rendering

Rendering interfaces this core data-structure to the outside world.
(Including in cases when that "outside world" has been defined by
code that lives within the system -- some sort of rendering may
be used by articles when they talk to each other.)  There isn't
a lot to say about it /except/ that of course anything you want
the user to be able to edit must be made available in an editable
form, and any conditions that you want to maintain across this
editing process must be maintained -- then the edited article(s)
need to get updated.  This is similar to the case described
for new articles above.

Rendering isn't that interesting, it just gets complicated in
special cases (e.g. clusions)...

* Making this distributed

It isn't hard to see how this system could work in one single
monolithic installation (and indeed, my Emacs+Arxana demo system works
pretty much as described here).  It is somewhat trickier to
think about how to make it distributed -- but that may be because
the discussants need to learn more about peer-to-peer systems
and other (?) distributivity models before going on. 

Expect updates on this part soon (see [[file:peer-to-peer_survey.org][peer-to-peer_survey]] for now)...

* Comments/discussion so far

It is amazing how much a system like this takes care of!  Another
thing to research is how this relates to any similar work by 
others (e.g. MathWeb's MBase project).

* So, Arxana is a DISTRIBUTED SEMANTIC NETWORK, then?

Googling around on this term, I found

 * [http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/ags/ai/publications/papers/Loemker1999-ADS.ps.gz A Distributed Semantic Network Language for Signal Understanding]

 * [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/8840/27974/01250194.pdf TROJAN: a scalable distributed semantic network system] (IEEE subscribers only)

 * [http://www.springerlink.com/index/LJ7758UH216M1825.pdf A distributed semantic network model for a collaborative intelligent system] (!SpringerLink subscribers only)

 * [http://webster.cs.uga.edu/~budak/papers/workshop02.pdf Towards Peer-to-Peer Semantic Web: A Distributed Environment for Sharing Semantic Knowledge on the Web]

and even

 * [http://csl.psychol.cam.ac.uk/publications/03_Tyler_NeuroImage.pdf Objects and their actions: evidence for a neurally distributed semantic system]

So it isn't like we're the first people to work on this sort of issue.
(In case you hadn't noticed, ARXANA backronyms to Another Really
Xenological Assocation Network Acronym.)

Does it somehow fill a special "niche"?  Maybe that niche is -- being
applied in a digital library setting?  I keep coming back to the ideas
from the [[file:metacommons manifesto.org][metacommons manifesto]], which suggest that these different
groups should probably be collaborating on something.  But I'll leave
it to you to think about more...

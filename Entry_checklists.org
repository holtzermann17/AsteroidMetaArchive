To help authors create entries (and to improve old entries) we could have entry checklists.
For example, for entries defining a topological property (say compact) 
there are a natural questions that should be answered:
 * How is the property preserved in subspaces?
 * How is the property preserved under maps?
 * Is it preserved under unions, intersections, products (finite, countable, arbitrary?)

On the other hand, for matrix operations (say matrix inverse) we 
could have another checklist
 * Special cases for small matrices (n=1,2, 3) and diagonal matrices?
 * What happens with eigenvalues, eigenvectors, norms, characteristic polynomial?
 * Calculation rules (sum, product, Kronecker product, derivative)?

This is a lot like the idea of a "frame" in AI.  A similar idea
was used in the old mac program !HyperCard. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

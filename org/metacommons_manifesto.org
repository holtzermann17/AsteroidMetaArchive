* New

Today after considerable delay I released a copy of the "metacommons
manifesto" on !PlanetMath, on the !PlanetMath mailing list, and to
several people who seem interested in supporting !PlanetMath.  The version I released is
http://planetmath.org/~jcorneli/everything/PM/manifesto-Nov15.pdf (or .tex). I am
putting a copy here too: feel free to add in-line comments or make changes.
(We are revising this for future publication and to make it a more effective
networking tool.)  Please see also [[file:PlanetMath Development Agenda.org][PlanetMath Development Agenda]] (a companion document).

New stuff more focused on developing a specifically "math-focused" metacommons is at [[file:Surveying the Math Metacommons.org][Surveying the Math Metacommons]].
Focusing on math could make some parts of the project more feasible; other parts may continue
to bleed out and be general.  Both approaches can be pursued in parallel.

* Metacommons Manifesto

by: Joseph Corneli, Aaron Krowne, Raymond Puzio

: The Metacommons Manifesto advocates for the cooperative
development of systems for doing commons-based peer production
(CBPP).  The discussion is informed by the experiences of the
authors working with a network of CBPP projects clustered around the
popular online mathematics community, !PlanetMath.org.  We discuss
challenges associated with formulating and enacting good policy in
the CBPP setting.  A metacommons would improve the situation, by
providing the means for various parties interested in CBPP policy
and infrastructure to share knowledge and coordinate work.

* Preamble

This is a document about producing tools and practices for doing
commons-based peer production.  We will talk about how this process
can be improved through the development of a metacommons.  In order to
make clear what we mean by this, we begin by defining the key terms.

Commons-based peer production (or CBPP) is a phrase first
used by Yale law professor Yochai Benkler to describe decentralized,
Internet-based collaborative projects .  In order to keep the
discussion simple, we will understand the term in somewhat greater
generality, and include within its scope all decentralized efforts
from which individuals derive some benefits from their participation,
and for which there is some organizing principle that facilitates
cooperation.



A key feature of CBPP is that it accumulates value associated with
positive externalities coming from the mediated interactions of
individuals.

We describe as meta-activities those activities associated with
managing a commons.  Meta-activities complement and support the
activities that take place within the commons itself.  Meta-activities
may themselves have peer-production components (e.g. peer review can
be considered to be a meta-activity), or they may be based on other
sorts of organizational arrangements (e.g. firms).  In particular,
meta-activities may or may not be carried out by the same group of
people who use the commons.  The precise
nature of meta-activities will, in general, depend on the nature of
the associated commons.




Commons-based peer production has shown itself to be important in many
areas, from business, to science, to entertainment, and beyond.  In
this document we will talk about how the idea of a metacommons
-- a commons for fostering the development of CBPP -- can be used to
make CBPP a even more effective means of producing value.

Our goals in writing this document are to open a channel of
communication with possible supporters; to talk about why improved tools for 
doing CBPP constitute an important social good; and ultimately to assemble a
productive team to work on CBPP issues.  We hope to help motivate and facilitate
the involvement of our readers in contributing to existing commons-based projects,
in starting new ones, and in changing norms, laws and society at
large in ways which facilitate the development of CBPP.  This
manifesto indicates and advocates an ongoing movement towards better
understanding of how to manage vital common resources of all kinds.

Our views are grounded, particularly, in the experiences we've had
with the wide array of meta-activities associated with running
!PlanetMath.org, a popular collaboratively-produced mathematics
website.  In order to develop a well-rounded exposition of a somewhat
broad topic, our opinions will be contextualized herein by our
experiences behind the scenes at !PlanetMath; our experiences with a
loose confederation of related projects; some discussion of the
relationships between these projects and other organizations; and
finally, our best attempt at conveying a broad social perspective on
the matter at hand.

Throughout history, human knowledge has grown to fill vast libraries,
and technology has become greatly refined.  And yet, past progress
merely sets the stage for future advancement.  Improvements to CBPP
are, fundamentally, improvements to the process of social progress
itself.

* What we would like to have happen
We want to make knowledge more available, expand knowledge, give more
people access to both content and to the process of knowledge
creation.  We want to effect social transformation towards the
participatory and empowered, fun, free, responsible, and sustainable.
In order to do this, we must understand knowledge production and
commons-based peer production from both social and technological
points of view.  We should build and support improved infrastructure
for knowledge production and communication.  We should work together
with others who share these goals, since it is by working together
that we will achieve the most.


* PlanetMath's goals are an interpreted version of our overall goals
!PlanetMath specifies our goals to the domain of mathematics.  With
this project, we aim to get a comprehensive and accessible source of
mathematical information online.  We are developing increasingly
powerful domain-specific tools which enable anyone to be involved in
mathematics as both a consumer and producer, and in important hybrid
roles, where, for example, a student's questions can become part of
future curricula.

!PlanetMath, and the software platform called Noosphere which supports it,
are not just valuable for their successes in the mathematics
domain -- they also constitute an ongoing experiment in CBPP.
Indeed, improving our CBPP framework is one of the core goals of the
!PlanetMath organization, since this will help us serve the needs of
all of our users better.

At the same time, it is clear to us that !PlanetMath cannot reach its
goals using a "pure CBPP" mode of operation.  In particular, we will
need a sustainable centralized organization to manage some parts of
the overall effort; a contemporary example would be development of the
Noosphere codebase (although we hope that in the future this
development effort can be made more decentralized).

As a rough comparison, while markets operate in a fundamentally
decentralized fashion, they nevertheless rely on the existence of a
central trading floor, which had to be put together at some cost.  The
!PlanetMath.org nonprofit plays this central coordinating role, and
also works to address the various needs of !PlanetMath users which are
not currently met through CBPP.  Accordingly, we have made developing
the !PlanetMath nonprofit an important high-level goal.


* The various projects we're working on embody different interpretations of these goals
!PlanetMath has become a beacon for people interested in "free math"
and CBPP for the mathematical sciences, and it is often the first
place that like-minded persons turn for help.  As a result, a number
of philosophically related projects are currently clustered around
!PlanetMath's organizational shell.

The Hyperreal Dictionary of Mathematics project is concerned with
building artificial intelligence for mathematics.  The project's main
goal is to use this software to get all known mathematics online,
without violating copyright law.

Metamath is a long-running project in formalized mathematics whose
developers have released a large quantity of formal mathematical
proofs to the public domain.  This project promises to have a
synergistic relationship with HDM.

Various other "planets" (e.g. PlanetPhysics) have been starting up,
to support knowledge communities working in various areas of inquiry.
We intend for Noosphere to facilitate content-sharing and other
collaborations between these several projects.

A theme common to a several next-generation collaboration tools we
have designed and started work on for !PlanetMath and HDM is that they
should facilitate naturally-overlapping communication between the
members of related knowledge communities.

As one example application, we're interested in using CBPP ideas as
the basis of a tool to help support the development of free/open
source software.  We call this project the "Code Market", after
Jordi Carrasco-Munoz .  In fact, the same ideas
that apply to this project could be used as a framework for producing
other public goods.


* Our commons-based projects depend on exchange with outside entities
Collaboration is important on an inter-project scale as well as on the
intra-project scale.  We might well hope to be significantly better at
collaboration than traditional (centralized, non-CBPP, top-down)
efforts, which still fail to be collaborative in any deep sense of the
word, resulting in considerable duplication of effort, and in many
potentially fruitful synergies getting ruled out out-of-hand.  A healthy
metacommons should facilitate fruitful exchanges and ongoing
collaborative relationships between various commons-based projects and
stakeholders.


* Improvements to CBPP can help us solve important problems
Any time society is confronted with a problem that requires an
organized effort (as all important problems do), there is utility in
having the following tools available: infrastructure that can support
large-scale, multi-domain collaborations; and infrastructure for
maintaining massively multi-dimensional information artifacts.

In other words, we should be able to build and work with information
artifacts that coherently incorporate many different facts, methods of
interpreting these facts, opinions, artistic displays, and computer
programs -- and so on -- and which lend themselves to the simultaneous
and fluid involvement of many participants.

Improved tools and theoretical models for CBPP are going to be of
widespread appeal.  However, research and development in this area is
associated with high initial cost, particularly since participation
from many different kinds of experts is called for.  

On the other hand, many different kinds of organizations are already
interested in CBPP (although some will know it by another name or
description).  Intuitively, CBPP development would be more efficient
if these groups could manage to work well together than if they do
not.














* How we plan to bring about our desired outcomes
We plan to organize each of our projects (!PlanetMath, HDM, Code
Market, etc.), and the collection of these projects as a whole, into a
coherent and fruitful commons.

The overall structure is of course going to be highly decentralized.
We plan to be working at suitable meta-levels, guiding the system as a
whole towards our stated goals.


* PlanetMath plans to become a more effective organization
We plan to provide improved support across the board for different
interest groups operating within !PlanetMath's commons.

In particular, we plan to add places to collaborate on and discuss
current research; and, similarly, to improve our support for basic
education by providing collaboration and learning tools for teachers
and students.

In order to achieve these development goals, our core organization is
going to need an income stream, as well as an influx of other
resources, which we will have to obtain as a combination of
arrangements with other organizations and contributions from
individuals.

So far, !PlanetMath users have not provided a sufficient source of
funds or other resources that would support our meta-level efforts.
This is because most users have (at best) exactly one kind of resource
to offer: volunteer effort directly related to their work in
mathematics.  We have therefore broadened our search for financial
support and peer producers interested in working at the meta-level.

Where it proves to be possible, we will expand our range of services
to include value-added items that financially-empowered groups of
users will be interested in paying for -- which, notably, does not
imply that the outputs have to be exclusively limited to this group,
as free/open source software nicely illustrates.  More abstractly, we
are looking for ways to better understand and communicate to various
groups of users the practical benefits they will obtain from
contributing to our efforts.

We are currently in the phase of seeking out and negotiating the
relevant relationships, and from this basis, formulating a suitable
development plan.




















* We want to help create a commons for developing CBPP projects

It is typically useful for any group to have one central place to
turn for information that is relevant to everyone in the group. 
For example, Google famously plays this role for Internet search.

We believe we can help create a set of central services which will be effective at
serving the specific needs of the groups whose work is aligned with our goals.
In particular, we hope to be able to develop a system for administering discussion fora
with integrated subchanneling, and other novel CBPP communication tools, to
share with everyone involved in our (thereby) coordinated effort.

In addition to generally facilitating better communication within and between
projects, we plan to give special emphasis to the development of tools for
sharing content.  The idea is for projects with different foci
to create diverse forms of content, which can then be reused creatively
throughout a broader information commons.  

Of course, this already happens to some degree.  But we want to
push for the development of a social and technological environment in
which it happens better.


* We plan to establish contact and suitable relationships with all of the organizations working on related things
Although the efforts we have mentioned are ambitious, they are widely
relevant, and we feel we can reasonably hope to garner support to
continue and expand them.  The NSF, the Department of Education, the
Library of Congress, the United Nations, Wikimedia, First Monday, GNU,
Google, various professional associations, foreign governments,
for-profit companies, and philosophical and philanthropic groups are
all likely to show some degree of support for the notions outlined in
this document, and to have some synergies with us moving forward.  It
might therefore make sense for some of these organizations to become
financial supporters of our projects, or directly aid in our work by
providing other vital resources, or otherwise collaborate with us in
the development of the metacommons.







* Improved communication channels can help people work together more effectively
Participants in practically any social organization, from city
government to large-scale social movement, will find their experience
enhanced by improved communication, access to relevant facts, and
means for considering and weighing alternative courses of action.
Understanding how to do these things well is what CBPP is all about.
Put another way, the key to CBPP is to create an integrative platform
that makes it easy for people to usefully share their work with others
without going too far out of their usual practice. 




* What we have done so far
The relationship between !PlanetMath and the wiki !AsteroidMeta, which
it shares with our other projects, illustrates how a successful
project can begin to take on the role of "project incubator."
!AsteroidMeta also shows how related projects can collaborate,
exchanging ideas and arranging to share resources as appropriate.  The
several projects collaborating through !AsteroidMeta have laid the
foundations for a successful "free math" movement, and are the
beginning of a promising CBPP development programme.

Over the course of its 5-year existence online, !PlanetMath has shown
that internet-based CBPP can be a success.  On the other hand, we've
seen that there are some things required for further growth that
!PlanetMath's commons does not provide.  We've started a 501(c)3
nonprofit to support !PlanetMath's development, and the strengths of
this organization should help balance the shortcomings of "pure
CBPP."


* We have been working to make PlanetMath into a sustainable organization
!PlanetMath has all the characteristics you would expect of a fledgling
non-profit.  Through our CBPP approach, we have all but solved the
sustainability problem for content (i.e., the content is fully
maintained by the community).  However, we're left with sustainability
problems related to project development and societal impact.

Specifically, we would like to ensuring that the !PlanetMath project
will continue through time and maximize its impact, without running
against shortages of resources that the project will need to in order
to bring this about.  The critical need is to balance volunteer effort
and the CBPP mode of production with reliable support coming from a
centralized organization devoted primarily to development and
outreach.

We believe that solving these problems for !PlanetMath would provide
many instructive lessons and, likely, tools, which could be applied in
other digital libraries and online community settings.  More
generally, we think it is likely that such solutions would be
applicable to cooperative organizations and constructive social action
in general.

We have been engaged with strategic planning meant to address these
points.  We have also been networking with other organizations that
are likely to be able to help us in these areas.


* We have a basic framework for inter-project collaboration
As a collaboration tool, our shared wiki !AsteroidMeta has a number of
shortcomings, for instance, a site-wide recent-changes page that
diminishes its value to readers who are not interested in reading
updates on all of the projects using the wiki.  However, it has
the strength of being usable for any however-tangentially-related
philosophical discussion connected to any of the projects or ideas
involved, and, indeed, it is out of these sorts of discussions that a
number of the projects have had their genesis (e.g. our Code Market).
In light of this, the wiki can certainly be considered to be a
preliminary success.  Improving !AsteroidMeta will be part of our
ongoing work to develop improved collaboration tools.


* Our networking successes so far have engendered a few promising partnerships, and a community of interest
!PlanetMath has become part of other broader efforts, including the
NSDL, CITIDEL, Wikipedia, the joint NSDL/MAA Math Gateway project, and Google's 2006 Summer of Code program.
We have also established a broad community of interest in our work,
both among "math people" and "free culture people."

We have furthermore identified items of potentially broad
interest within our other projects (and in cases, we have found
people who want to collaborate with us in developing these items).


* Various institutions for addressing large-scale problems already exist, in centralized and decentralized forms
Universities and the Internet are two of the institutions that have
helped to established a broad cultural commons.  Why do we want a
metacommons when these great institutions already exist?  Indeed,
existing markets and laws could presumably be relied upon to
coordinate CBPP development.  However, the ansatz driving this
manifesto is that we can be still more efficient if we apply the
strategy of CBPP development to the development of CBPP itself.

Historical precedent for improvements in CBPP bringing about improved
efficiency in cultural production is found in, e.g., Mersenne.
Research on CBPP can show the way to further breakthroughs in
efficiency.




* What is needed to implement our plans
Sustainability entails building sustainable relationships between
various entities.  One needs to know who to turn to for what.  In any
given organization the conditions for sustainability will have both
external and internal components.

Building sustainable relationships is currently our main focus.  We
have seen many great ideas, but unless an effort can last long enough
to achieve results, all the good ideas in the world don't amount to
much.

In order to be successful, we will need ongoing investments of work effort,
money, attention, knowledge, etc.; and of course a work product which is
worthy of these investments.


* PlanetMath continues to need organizational development
We have sufficient funds in our budget to begin to offer a small amount of money
to consultants (whether professional or amateur) to help with our organization's
internal structuring and strategic positioning.  We hope as well to attain
gratis or quid-pro-quo help with organizational development from persons
and organizations in positions of influence or ability.
Indeed, this sort of thing that we hope that a metacommons could help provide.

Among other organizational issues that !PlanetMath will have to address
are the role of members, exactly what sort of staff we will be able to
support, and how much and what kinds of
help we will be able to offer to other projects.











* As our commons grows, we will need improved strategies for communication
There are many people who are working on things
that are related to the things we are working on who nevertheless we
are not collaborating with.  This is something we would like to
change; even relatively weak collaborations (e.g. sharing research
reports) would be a big improvement.  We expect that other 
researchers share our sentiments.


* We need to know more about the resource landscape
The metacommons begins with simple networking.
As we work to improve our network, we will need to think strategically
about our relationships with other groups.  Sometimes we may not know
immediately who we will be able to count on for a given resource, and
other times we may not be taken seriously on our own.  In either of
these cases, a third party may help us succeed.  Sometimes we may need
to involve fourth or fifth parties in order to secure a good position!


* Those concerned with solving societal problems will have to first solve the investment problem
It might appear that the largest problems facing society will require
immense new investment if they are to be solved.  Whether or not this
is the case, one should not imagine that the world's largest problems
will be solved de novo.  No matter what the level of new
investment is, people will have to figure out how to capitalize on
existing and preceding efforts.  Another basic fact is that costs can
be reduced by find new ways to exploit widespread enduring effects,
for example, by creating forms of entertainment which have the
property that small increments of value are returned from the
consumer's participation.




* What you can do to help
If you value the goals we mentioned above, then you should find a way to
coordinate with other system agents (e.g. developers) some exchange or
division of labor that will secure us all a better position.


* You can help by connecting PlanetMath with the resources it needs to foster free math and CBPP development
!PlanetMath can become a key site on the Internet not only for free
math, but also for CBPP.    You may be able to help us
get there.  At this point what we need most is to be able to engage
a few developers.


* Support project development and inter-project communication
Many of our projects are in very early stages of development; in fact,
even those project we can safely say to be well-begun are in a
relatively early stage, compared to what we expect from them
eventually.  All of our projects will need further investments if they
are going to do new and exciting things.  You can help us by funneling
appropriate investments to these projects.


* Be specific about what you have to offer
By the same token, if we have not been clear on what we're bringing to
the table, please ask us questions!  As the network of groups and
individuals supporting our projects grows, managing the associated
information about who is doing what will become a large-scale
collaborative project in its own right.  Indeed, that is the purpose
of the metacommons.


* You can help by using and developing CBPP
Figuring out what role or roles are best for you to take relative to
the commons is likely to be highly non-trivial.  Luckily, we can all
make use of the strategy of progressive improvements.

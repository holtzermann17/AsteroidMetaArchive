I'm a founder of PlanetMath and the main developer, administrator, and evangelist.

This if course also makes me the founder and principal of the [[file:Noosphere.org][Noosphere]] project as well.

I am interested in seeing both projects become sustainable, grow, and support extensions and offshots by others.

My home page is here: http://br.endernet.org/~akrowne/.

See [[file:Goals.org][Goals]] for my personal goals relative to AsteroidMeta projects.

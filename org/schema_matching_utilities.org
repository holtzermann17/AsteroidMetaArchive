* Matching Schemata

This a suite of utilities to match expressions and schemata.

A "schema" can be considered to be a list template.  A schema is said to
/represent/ a list if that list can be obtained by substituting suitable lists
for the wildcards.  For example, the list /(if (if a b) (if (c (if a b))))/ is
represented by the "arbitrary premise rule" /(if x (if y x))/.

We see this is the case because it can be obtained from the rule by the
substitutions

 (if a b)  for  x
 
     c     for  y.

In this article, we make the notion of a schema and schema substitution precise,
and then present some code that can "match" a list to a schema in the manner
illustrated here.

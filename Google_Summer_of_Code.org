I just received my rejection email for the Google's Summer of Code program. It would be fun to know if HDM was allowed any spots at all, and if so, who was accepted. --[[file:shargestam.org][shargestam]]

I also got the rejection letter of doom. I'm also interested if there was anyone else who got in. --[[file:pekuja.org][pekuja]]

No one that I know of!  I just heard from someone else whose application never
even made it to me & Ray.  This is sort of distressing.  Since your applications
were good, I can only assume that the project itself isn't to Google's taste.
I have gotten no further explanation from them. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

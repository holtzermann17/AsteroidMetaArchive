Hi Juha, thanks for posting.  It would be great for us to be able to
ride on your coattails for a while.  Some additional documentation of
the Bourbaki prover would be great to see; maybe we can help, at least
by asking you questions.  See [[file:Updates to the HDM documentation.org][Updates to the HDM documentation]] for
a link to some of our documentation; maybe you can write a short report
on Bourbaki to add to this collection? --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

Each of the topics mentioned in the [[file:HDM Directory.org][HDM Directory]] is 
a window through which to view the entire project.  In other words,
if you wanted to think of this as a math project, a linguistics project,
an AI project, or a human-computer interface project, you wouldn't
be dead wrong.

However, the project is by 
its nature inter-, /and probably trans-/, disciplinary.  So, trying
to fit it into some traditional academic category is likely to cramp
its own unique style.

A while ago the proliferation of options for joint editing of
semantic networks seemed overwhelming to me.  There are many
paths to the truth, they say, don't spend your life choosing between them!

One of the options that looks best to me right now is to use 
SimpleNet in combination with a shared REPL provided by
qcmu 
(this software is mentioned at http://www.cons.org/cmucl/doc/lispserver.html, and a link is given to sources that can be wget got).

I'm still not completely sure how to set up qcmu.

As for other options, the idea of doing something with a CMS - like
CVS - still seems reasonable.  However, a shared REPL seems like
something fun to play with.  If they can do it for MUDs, I should
be able to do it with LISP...

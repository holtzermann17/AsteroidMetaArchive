One of the minor nuissances of a mathaematicians life is having to put up with different, sometimes conflicting notations.  Chern once defined differential geometry as the study of invariants under changes of notation.

Technology can offer assistance to the beleagured mathematician by automatically translating between notations.  One way of accomplishing this is by using our parser.  First, we read in a formula written in notation A and translate it into h-code.  Second, we have translate this h-code into notation B.  By using h-code as a common meeting-ground, it is easier to write translation programs for notations.  

* Discussion

This ability will also keep PM/HDM looking current in 50 years. Another important thing is that
translations will be very easy. One only has to translate the rendering code.

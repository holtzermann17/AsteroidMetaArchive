Welcome to the wikik !GrafZahl.  Looking at your
wikisource page makes me think you should talk to
Ray Puzio about a giant project to enumerate and
scan many public-domain math texts.  He's
available through planetmath@googlegroups.com or
other ways... and some of the relevant pages
are on this wiki if you can find them. (Search
for Library of Congress?)

: Thanks for the welcome. I'm not exactly sure what he's up to, but I've sent him an e-Mail (and I've added a link above).--[[file:GrafZahl.org][GrafZahl]]

Ocat: Thanks for the spirited note.  I've done a little wikignoming
that I think will make it easier to comment on the individual parts of
what you wrote. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

I have now completed my wikignoming and I've added some cursory comments.
Sorry not to go into more detail or add more references.  I like
the work you've done here, and would like to come back to this more
in the future.  --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

Probably the basis of this system will be KM.  I am less sure than
I was whether anything major will need to be done to KM to make it
work for our representation needs.  What is needed is some separate
reasoning modules that can handle nested quantifiers.  Look into this,
and get started.  Use previous work by [[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] on representation of theorems and proofs.

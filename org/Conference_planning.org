This page is for "planning our attack" on conferences related to the topics 
of this Wiki site.  People should post any conference that they think it is
likely they will be going to (or at least possible with compelling enough 
material) and has any track, session, topic, or emphasis that has to do with
anything on this site that could be reported or publicized. 

Examples of types (and specific instances) of conferences, forums, meetings, 
or symposia that could be fair game are on:

 * digital libraries (e.g. JCDL, ECDL, ICADL)
 * computer science 
 * anything with math and computers
 * learning technologies
 * collaboration 
 * computer-supported cooperative work
 * systems (e.g. HICSS)
 * knowledge management
 * artificial intelligence and machine learning 
 * information retrieval (e.g. SIGIR)
 * virtual communities
 * digital rights
 * the world wide web (e.g. WebWise)

The result we 
are going for is that we will utilize more presentation opportunities, 
better utilize the ones we have, get more of us involved even in conferences
only one of us are going to, and inform each other of our activities related
to this site's topics outside of this site.

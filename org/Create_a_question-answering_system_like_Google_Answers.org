A tip-based question-answering system sort of like
[http://answers.google.com/answers/ Google Answers] would give users a chance to
pick up some money by answering math questions.  The content of these answers
would be available under the [[file:FDL.org][FDL]] and could be used in the encyclopedia.
Furthermore, if [[file:PM.org][PM]] took some percentage of each tip, this could be a way to
generate revenue for the site.

We could combine this idea with a membership drive, so that only a member could
collect tips by answering questions. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

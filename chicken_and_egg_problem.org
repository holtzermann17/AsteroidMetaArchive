On the chicken side, since the h-code is still under development, one can't
really translate into a language which doesn't exist.  On the egg side, to
develop h-code properly, we need these examples to make sure that it is an
adequate medium for expressing mathematics.  To get out of these impasse, we
improvise.  Based on our ideas of h-code should be like and the definition or
proof we are studying, we make a guess at to what an h-code version should look
like.  Based on this, we work on our definition of h-code and improve the
translations.  By this iterative process, we hope to arrive at a consistent
symbolic representation which adequately represents mathematics.  However, as
with any iterative process, we need an initial approximation to start the
process, and so it would be nice to have a few more proofs.

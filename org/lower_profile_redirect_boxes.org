This is of course a non-issue in Lynx, but sometimes I use graphical
browsers (and I assume most people use them most of the time), and
with these browsers, redirected pages contain a big ugly red box.
(See for example [[file:HDM.org][HDM]].)  Is it possible to adjust stylesheets or
something like this to make the way redirected pages look somewhat less obtrusive?

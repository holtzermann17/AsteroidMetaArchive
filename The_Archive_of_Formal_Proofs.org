* What is the Archive of Formal Projects?

The Archive of Formal Proofs is a collection of proof libraries, examples, and
larger scientific developments, mechanically checked in the theorem prover
Isabelle. It is organized in the way of a scientific journal. Submissions are
refereed. We aim to strengthen the community and to foster the development of
formal proofs.  We aim to strengthen the community and to foster the development

: a central, citable place for authors to publish their theories

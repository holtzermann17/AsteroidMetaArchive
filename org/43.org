This is an obscene spammer.

This wiki seems to be filling up with people
who make up random usernames to either post 
or remove spam.

I'll have to give another shot at accounts soon. --[[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]]

Just so you guys know, Ghestalt is already quite usable as a generic wiki,
and has accounts. When spammers script the account generation there,
as they have done for Advogato and JSPWiki, I'll make it work by
invitations.

Sharing wiki infrastructure would be a good way to continue working
together. I appreciate you hosting the Metamath and Ghilbert discussion,
so maybe this is a way to repay you for that.

We need 12 PM volunteers to pose half-naked in front of cop cars
from their locality for location-stamping purposes.  These are then stitched together to produce
a Playboy- (or I guess I should say Playgirl-) style calendar.  The
theme is "(Planet)Math is sexy".  Not only can we sell the calendars for ~$3
a piece, the calender will have high sex appeal, and we will attract
all the math girls!  (Note: I am assuming ~95% of the initial population
of 12 will be male.)  

When selling them, we should say: take one for your mom, your sister,
one for every room in the house; that'll be $42, thanks.

Can't see what not to like about this idea...

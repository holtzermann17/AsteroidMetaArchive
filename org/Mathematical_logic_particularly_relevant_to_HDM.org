* Fun stuff

; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_graph : This seems like
a reasonable place to start reading about C. S. Pierce.  Has apparently
been expanded into "conceptual graphs", see http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/204/ibmrd2004E.pdf

* Classical mathematical logic

; Enderton : (recommended by Boyer)
; Kleene : (recommended by Boyer)
; Mendelson : (recommended by Boyer)
; Shoenfield : (recommended by Boyer)
; /Principa Mathematica/ by Rusell and Whitehead: 
; Hilbert, David and Ackermann, Wilhelm, 1928, /Grundz√ºge der theoretischen Logik,/ Berlin: Springer.
; /Mathematical Logic/ by W. v. O. Quine: The inventor of quotation and quasi-quotation among other things
; /First Order Logic/ by Raymond R. Smullyan: A nice discussion of natural deduction

* Contemporary mathematical logic

; Makarov's D-logic : Ray likes this, I don't know the details; basically, logic with definitions?
: [[file:norm.org][norm]]: While I've only skimmed the 
[[file:http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/cs/pdf/9906/9906010.pdf D-logic paper.org][http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/cs/pdf/9906/9906010.pdf D-logic paper]], one
of its advantages seems to be that it
[[http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/1999-March/002857.html
incorporates Hilbert's epsilon]] in the first-order logic.  However, it
is also possible to emulate Hilbert's epsilon with ZFC set theory.  I
have worked out the details for [[file:metamath.org][metamath]], which are described in a
[[http://us2.metamath.org:8888/downloads/megillaward2005he.pdf slide
show]] that I presented at the
[[http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~mccune/award-2005/ 2005 Argonne AR
Workshop]].  As you can see in Slide 16, it seems that a trivial
number of additional steps are needed for the emulation, in apparent
conflict with the statement that the
"[[http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/1999-March/002850.html Hilbert
operator...allows shorter proofs than the axiom of choice]]"
(implying the difference is significant), although
maybe there's something I'm overlooking.  I think [[file:raph.org][raph]] is using or will
use the technique for translating HOL to [[file:Ghilbert.org][Ghilbert]], so his experience
should reveal the practicality of the technique.--[[file:norm.org][norm]] 20-Nov-05


* Metamathematics
; /A Theory of Sets/ by A. P. Morse :  Morse was the Ph. D. advisor of Bledsoe
 (Bledsoe was Boyer's advisor and this book was recommended by Boyer).  It would
 be interesting to compare to [[file:metamath.org][metamath]].
: [[file:norm.org][norm]]: I would like very much to hear a review from someone who has actually
studied and understands it - it is hard to find knowledgeable opinions
about it, pro or con.  I spent perhaps an hour with the book, and to be
honest it wasn't enough time for me to "get it" or even understand the
notation, which is highly unconventional and perhaps a reason it hasn't
caught on.  So far I haven't been motivated to spend the day or more it
might require me to "get it," but am open to becoming inspired if
someone convinces me.  There's no denying that it is quite novel,
and it seems to be deeper than just a
different notation for first-order logic.  The notation is built up
with a complex hierarchy of definitions with names that are quite
colorful (as you'll see from the index) but that often correspond
to nothing familiar I could mentally connect with conceptually.
I had the vague
feeling that it doesn't distinguish propositional variables and
individual variables, which - if that is the case - might make it
difficult
to grasp.  The language is said to be amenable to computer
implementation, which would be an advantage, and it would be interesting
to compare the complexity of a Morse set theory verifier with the
Metamath-type verifiers.  Or to determine whether Morse set theory is
expressible in Metamath.
What would be helpful to me would be some examples of its
notation directly compared with their 
standard first-order logic equivalents, which the author as far as
I could tell did not provide.  In any case,
I think Metamath's set.mm may be closer to conventional notation, and notationally
easier to understand, than Morse set theory. --[[file:norm.org][norm]] 20-Nov-05


; /Set Theory and Logic/ by Robert R. Stoll: A rather accessible treatment of the theory of axiomatic systems
; Hilbert, David and Bernays, Paul, 1934, /Grundlagen der Mathematik,/ Berlin: Springer.

; /Set Theory and Its Logic/ by W. v. O. Quine:
: [[file:norm.org][norm]]: Quine's /Set Theory and Its Logic/ is a classic
and a pleasure to read.  Pp. 15-21 are a "must read" for anyone who wants
to understand the class variables (Quine's "virtual classes")
used in Metamath and in set theory
in general.  Under set theory, all common mathematical objects such
as the number "1" can be IMO most simply defined as virtual classes.
Virtual classes are so commonly used that it is
important to understand them correctly (and many people don't)
in order to connect standard objects to their
set theoretical foundation.  I'm puzzled why so many introductory
set theory books sometimes go to extremes to avoid the
elegance of virtual class theory,
making their notation in some cases quite awkward (e.g. Suppes, whose
class builders collapse to the empty set when they get too big,
leading to strange theorems like {x|x=x}=0).  In his set theory class
in the early 90's
(the text for which was Enderton with no virtual class theory), George Boolos quickly
introduced virtual classes in his lectures for convenience - with 
reference to Quine as "the best exposition" - and used them
as his workhorse and in [[http://us2.metamath.org:8888/mpegif/setind2.html
homework]].  --[[file:norm.org][norm]] 20-Nov-05

** Why PlanetLinguistics?

First of all, someone should work on documenting the uses of !LaTeX among
linguists (probably a quick websearch would reveal the basics).  I know it is
fairly popular, but how popular?  Does a [[file:Noösphere.org][Noösphere]]-based encyclopedia of
linguistics even make sense?  

Personally, it seems like having a good linguistics reference would be very
valuable for the [[file:HDM.org][HDM]] project, as we think about developing parsers and text
generators.  Indeed, the HDM should in theory make it possible to translate
mathematical texts automatically between all human languages -- but we would
need to know a lot about the languages that we were working with.  So I envision
[[file:PL.org][PL]] not just as a reference work, but as a tool with which to
build an "actionable" linguistics KB.  (The actionable layer should be released
under the [[file:GPL.org][GPL]].)

To me, creating something like this seems like a priority.  But I would like to
get some more feedback about the idea from Noösphere people and anyone who knows
more about linguistics than I do. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Sun Feb 13 13:27:31 2005

In addition, it would be nice to have something on formal linguistics here, since
that is certainly an important component of the [[file:h-code.org][h-code]] subproject.  --[[file:rspuzio.org][rspuzio]]

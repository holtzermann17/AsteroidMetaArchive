I think that ghilbert may be even better for us, but it is not
explicitly free.  So one task is to

 * [[file:see about licensing conditions for ghilbert.org][see about licensing conditions for ghilbert]]

If it isn't free, we may want to do something similar, looking
at the documentation, not at the code.  Hmm.  I expect the author
will be reasonable.

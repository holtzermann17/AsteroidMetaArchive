Here we've got the goals of PlanetMath organized as a "goal tree".  
All the sub-goals flow naturally from the core (but vague) goal of PlanetMath (stated at the top).
It is a pretty intuitive format; feel free to expand it, and link off goals to pages on the wiki.

 *!PlanetMath Goal Tree:*

 * increase accessibility of mathematical knowledge using CBPP
  * improve content creation, enhancement
   * improve CBPP process support (improve workflow support in Noosphere)
   * properly incentivize CBPP activities
  * improve dissemination
   * improve access to the web site
    * improve availability of web site
    ** fix bugs in Noosphere
    ** fix scalability problems in Noosphere
   * get PlanetMath content "carried" in more outlets
    * get Noosphere instances to share content more easily
   * get PlanetMath delivered in more formats
    * book
    * CD
    * misc (e.g., edutainment TV?)
  * improve outreach
   * get PlanetMath or its derivatives used in classrooms
   * get PlanetMath or its derivatives used in practice
  * improve pedagogy
   * make core content easier to understand
   * get learners more actively involved in forum aspects of the web site
   * add and integrate level/difficulty metadata
  * improve impact
   * improve quality
    * improve reputation systems
    * add ratings
    * give incentives to use real-world identities
    * put in collaborative filtering
   * improve information-seeking
    * improve searching system
    * improve browsing system
    * add collection visualization systems
  * champion free content
   * move to support creation of free books, papers, expositions

: I think it is a good design, I added a little to the tree.  I think that
indeed every node in the tree could be or contain a link, if an explanation of
that idea would be helpful.  For example, "properly incentivize CBPP activities"
seems somewhat vague; maybe it could be expanded into a small essay on a
separate page.  --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Sat Mar 12 14:57:52 2005 UTC

Come to think of it (not to be pedantic or anything), but
most of these "goals" actually look like what's called
"objectives" in the literature.  --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Jan 11 06

Interesting to note that objectives can be used as part of a 
process of marketizing goals; cf. [[file:marketize feature requests.org][marketize feature requests]]. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

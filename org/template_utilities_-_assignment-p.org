 *Usage:* /(assignment-p expr)/

 *Input:* an s-expression /expr/

 *Output:* /t/ or /nil/

 *Description:* If /expr/ is a valid [[file:Definition of assignment | assignment.org][Definition of assignment | assignment]], then /assignment-p/ returns /t/, otherwise it returns /nil/.

 *Dependencies:* none

 *Listing:*

 (defun assignment-p (expr) 
   (cond ((null expr) nil)
         ((atom expr) nil)
         ((not (equal (length expr) 2)) nil)
         ((not (atom (car expr))) nil)
         (t t)))

 *Discussion:*  This program works by systematically excluding every s-expression which is not an assignment and then certifying that whatever has not been excluded must be a bona fide assignment.  First, the program excludes nil, then atoms, then lists which do not have two elements, then lists with two elements whose first item is not an atom.

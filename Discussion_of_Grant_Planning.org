I don't know what you mean by the term "lay learners"
in the overview of the NSF "ALT".  Are these people
who learn just for fun (amateurs, I think is the
term I've heard)?  

I would suggest that the focus here should be on amping
up the efficacy for /students/ (which class of persons
also includes autodidacts).  

Not sure about the idea of "extending the impact from
specialists to students" either, since, in fact, I 
don't know if we know where the impact really lies.
(I would expect that in fact non-specialist students,
i.e., undegrads and beginning grad students, are already 
the most strongly affected group).

Measures to assess the impact of PM could be good, as in my
post in the forum about a Who Are You? poll.  
(But I don't know if this is the sort of thing we want to
focus on in a grant application of this sort - seems 
better to connect it to the addition/population of 
"level" metadata, and spin it that way -- which, in fact,
makes perfectly good sense, at least from the point of view
of answering the caterpillar's question: if we had level
metadata and level settings, we could read off the number 
of people who were browsing the "high school" level, the 
"undergrad" level, and so on.

Indeed, in addition to "level", it might be useful to have
metadata for "specialty" as well (returning to the roots
of this note!) -- just in case someone wanted to restrict
themselves to an "algebra" view on the encyclopedia or whatever
(for example).  This sort of metadata could be useful for
controlling automatic linking behavior, searches, etc.

I do owe you a definition there.  "Lay learners" may have been a bad term, but 
what I meant was not necessarily amateur or "for fun" learners.  I was in fact thinking more of
students, but considering that students these days are more generalists than 
specialists (even through the undergraduate years, and increasingly, even masters-level studies).
Generalists do not usually have the time or desire to get too involved 
in the learning process.  It is even worse than this, actually, as college has
become expected, planned, and even obligatory, both as part of suburban culture, and 
as expected industrial training.  So, I cannot see such people really "delving in" to 
literate programming with the HDM in order to learn mathematics.

I think this situation is kind of a shame.  I think both amateur learners and 
classically scholastic-minded persons (autodidactics who happen to be 
taking advantage of a university environment) would be willing to take
more initative over their education.  But the vast majority of learners are 
formal students, whom the NSF is under a lot of pressure to serve, and whom need to be
 "spoon fed".   So, while CBPP content creation and literate formal mathematics 
clearly help the content producers learn better, institutions like NSF will want to
know how this applies to the left-and-center portions of the Bell curve (distributed over both
ability and motivation), and how to make this more so.

In sum, I think I used the term "lay learners" because this now better describes your 
typical formally-institutionalized student, along with the connotations of being
"less involved" than an optimally motivated learner would be. --[[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]]

OK, I got ya.  And, while I don't particularly like "playing into" the system
you're talking about, I can recognize that the system is pervasive, and
culturally important in early-21st century america (i.e. right now!).

And, for the purposes of the grant, I can see that positioning ourselves to
explicitly serve this population is likely to be a Good Thing.  Especially (and
you would probably say "only") if it can be done in a way that doesn't cut out
the "right" side of that distribution, i.e., our "base", to quote someone famous
;).

Luckily, I think that we can do a lot of things that will likely serve the
"lay-scholar" and the Ã¼ber-scholar.  Not to harp on it too much, but literate
programming -- and its results -- comes to mind for me as an example.  On the
one hand, literate programming is a great tool for hackers and aspirant-hackers
and other folks in the top 80% or so of the motivation distribution.  On the
other hand, if these folks are interested in working to support popular
education, which many of them, including the two of us for example, are, then
they will use these tools, in part, to build user-friendly (/not/ to say
dopey) things that enhance the educational experience of the less
motivated/trained.

Gnome comes to mind as an example of this sort of thing.  Built by hackers,
but geared towards the general population.  

Note that I'm not saying that literate programming is magically going to make
education better for everyone.  We'd still have the problem of 
[[file:Getting programmers is hard|finding programmers.org][Getting programmers is hard|finding programmers]], helping guide the system
along so that the content that is produced is good and useful, and so on -
all the issues we're already familiar with, and some new (technical) ones.

But I am saying that it seems to be an example of the sort of thing that makes
it easier to cater to a wide population of students, and perhaps this is the
way to pitch it: "!PlanetMath already supports the collaborative creation of
expository articles, this new system would enable us to collaboratively create
and attach interactive components to these articles.  This is recognized to
be of significant positive educational value because of [bla bla bla] research
studies."

And I think this is actually true.

There are a few points that may be worth discuss further, which spin off from
here.  

First, I said above that our base is on the right of the motivation curve.  I
think that is true.  When I was talking with Joe Konstan, I estimated that most
of the messages in the forums, for example, come from seasons site veterans, not
from students asking questions or talking about homework or undergraduate-level
research problems (and certainly not from professionals).  I'm definitely way in
favor of figuring out ways to make the site actually be more useful for average
mathematical folks to get use out of.  Enhancements to the forum system are
certainly ahead of literate programming and interactive documents on the list of
things to do to improve this situation, but I think these other features (which
I'm personally "more interested in", largely because they are how /my/
collaborations would be facilitated) are good as supporting items.  I.e., they
are good for non-specialists (even in the short run).

Second, I also think it would be good for us to think some (both now, and as
time goes by) about "amateurs" (here the word is meant to be taken in a positive
light) and other persons involved in "alternative education".  I think
!PlanetMath already has some features that are great for this small, weird, but
often highly motivatied group.  Just as a brainstormed idea, PM could host
live/in-person minicourses, which would center around the discussion and
exploration (using the noosphere system as well as live/in-person discussion
media) of some chosen mathematical topic, led by some expert or experts.  The
same sort of thing could be done on line too.  The KGS (Kisedo Go Server) does
online Go instruction in a somewhat similar vein, using their software.  (And,
in terms of money, only paid-up members are able to "attend" these classes.)

This is not necessarily alternative education for people who "do" alternative
education; it is an "alternative education"-like format that could work for lots
of different groups.

The class that you described to me that used Noosphere as a primary course
resource was a great example of this.  And /this/ topic shows how increasing
the ease with which Noosphere can be installed creates new educational
opportunities, especially if taken in combination with some new/useful features.
Furthermore, there is nothing (especially) that says that Noosphere couldn't be
used in this way to help teach very middle-of-the-road students.  I definitely
think that [[file:a course featuring very interactive online PM-like components.org][a course featuring very interactive online PM-like components]]
would certainly have served me better when I was a grad student, insofar as I
was at that time trying (to some extent) to actually learn material.  But of
course, I think I am somewhat atypical in terms of accepting computers into my
daily mathematical life - other students might not be as into it.  However, I
think that the class you described shows that something along these lines
can profitably be done.

I think we should probably be looking at some books on grant writing.
I found a few in my local library; I could start some pages about grant-writing
strategies, using these books as the basis.  If we get good at grant-writing,
then there's no reason we shouldn't be able to get grants... right? --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

Certainly it can't hurt.  But I think past successes and the roster of names 
involved exert a huge, if not majority, influence.  In terms of the technicals
of writing, I think you can sum it all up as "explain things simply and clearly,
and market your effort well."  But frankly, a lot of the awarded grants I've seen 
were not the most amazing documents, technically.  --[[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]] Sat Jul 16 19:16:35 UTC 2005

As you put it, it can't hurt.  A good strategy would consider this
"meta" stuff you are talking about (names, past successes), and presumably
good books would talk about this stuff, too.  When I say "grant writing",
I really mean a much bigger process.  --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

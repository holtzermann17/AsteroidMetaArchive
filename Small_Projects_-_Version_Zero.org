As a proof of concept, one could consider a miniature version of HDM which is restricted to propositional logic.  The components of this would include:

 * A subset of h-code which is sufficient for encoding proofs and definition in propositional logic

 * An automatic proof checker for propositional logic.

 * A parser which can translate between conventional notations of symbolic logic and h-code.

 * A database of results in propositional logic.  This can be obtained by processing the metamath database through the parser.

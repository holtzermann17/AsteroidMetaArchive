Ilya Mezhirov

A student of Moscow State University.

In an effort to understand what it is like to formalize math,
I have written a proof checker [[file:ufomath.org][ufomath]] at http://ufomath.wikispaces.com .
Going to play with it for a while.

Welcome, Ilya! Great to hear about your project! The

later? P.S. delete this note to clean up the page :)

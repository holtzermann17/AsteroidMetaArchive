Things like use of real names, really high quality prose, and publication of the [[file:FEM.org][FEM]]
will enhance the way [[file:PM.org][PM]] looks to the outside world.  We should think more
about what other things might enhance PM's profile, and then do them.

I think we should add references to all (or as many) entries. It might be worth adding a required field in the creation-page of entries, where the author has to add a reference where the concept/theorem can be contrasted/verified. -alozano

: Or if not a required field, at least we could have a correction class "Missing Reference". --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

Some of these cards are due to friends.  You shouldn't expect
them to stay the same for long, so if you play me, watch out ;).

It is interesting to notice outright redundancies as well as more
subtle themes in the cards.

Let's also not forget "Beacon" --- that was one of my favorites in our game on the bus. --[[file:rspuzio.org][rspuzio]]

Yeah, that was a good card.  I'm not quite sure why I culled it.  But the
rules of the game say 100 cards is the limit, so either I'll have to substitute
it for something here or build another deck with it in it.  Since I've now
got the second edition of my newsletter "The Beacon" percolating in my
brain and among my neighbors, perhaps the thing to do is to work on ontologizing
the historical record of these Beacons.  E.g. the new card would presumably
include a quote from Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness',

: /Each station should be like a
beacon on the road towards better things, a center for trade of course,
but also for humanizing, improving, instructing./

(A deeply ironic statement in its context.)

I was happy to remember in our conversation last night that "Fear of the Unknown"
is one of the cards here.  Not unrelated to Conrad's book, either, but again
in an ironic way.

(BTW, don't worry, 'culled' doesn't mean destroyed; I have a large backfile
of old cards.)

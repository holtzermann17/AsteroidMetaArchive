Ah, the semantic web...  what is it?

I don't know, but here is a recent article about the topic that
tickles my current interest:

 * [http://eliterature.org/pad/slw.html Toward a Semantic Literary Web].

A couple quotes:

1. "Who are you to say, what is valuable and what is not? How do you
know that the values you were trained to see, aren't being transformed
along with the transformation in the culture generally?" The fact that
the questioner's refusal to state value is then ceded to other,
usually commercial, authorities, is rarely addressed.

2. With the help of the [http://www.futureofthebook.org Institute for
the Future of the Book], we have designed what i think is a really
interesting interface to help share the text with the public in a way
that opens the possibility of discussion and critical reception as
part of the process of 'publishing', rather than as something that
happens only afterwards.

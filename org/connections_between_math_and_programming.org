*  Literate programming and PlanetMath

: But I am not convinced that the connections between math and programming
(which [seem to underlie the ideas you've suggested be part of this grant application])
will play out the way you think they will.
There is something very different about the two.  The way I see it, programming
is still the absolutely last thing you want to force a learner to do, not
necessarily because it wouldn't be good for them, but because it will make them
intensely hate the learning.  Programming is a tedious thing; even I find it to
be this.  I don't think literate programming improves the situation much; I
think it just makes programming and documentation tolerably efficient /for
programmers/.  I don't see the typical learner embracing these practices.  It
also seems to be thrusting an extra duty onto the content-producer to have to
produce code-calibre output.  You can respond that math is already almost code,
but this "almost" is large enough that even hardened mathematicians acted quite
vigorously against having APM-Xi on PlanetMath.

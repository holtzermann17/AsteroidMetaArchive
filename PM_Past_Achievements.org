* Discussion

I realize that this is supposed to be about PM, but the early history
seems to ignore plenty of potentially interesting things.  E.g. there
is no mention of HDM (so, why did we think to try OWIO), no mention of
!MathWorld going offline, no mention of Puzio's CRATE project, the
creation of the Internet, !TeX, GNU FDL, etc.

I also realize that any history has to be selective, but given the
interconnectedness of all things, it is also important to lay out some
meta-historical principles that explain exactly how information is
selected for the history.  Otherwise, the document causes ?'s to be
emitted.

This is not a purely academic exercise, since knowing where we've
been says something about where we will be going (as everyone
is accutely aware right now, since it is currently Black History Month).
A reasonable history should include not only discussion of the 
motivation for writing the history, but the motivations of the
persons described in the history at the various points in time
that are mentioned.

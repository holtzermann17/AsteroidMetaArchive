Most important: nothing without compatible terms (FDL or PD are all I know of)
can be used.  There have been plenty of [[file:Discussions.org][Discussions]] about how to use
math found in other sources.

If someone says that you have "permission" to use their book, double check -
get it all in writing (we should have standard forms to use) or have
them upload it themselves.


In general, I think adding large works work better if PM had better
support for books, see [[file:PlanetMath engine interbred with wikibooks idea.org][PlanetMath engine interbred with wikibooks idea]].

For now, its true that wiki pages can be used to manage the influx of books.
But I worry that this could get somewhat overwhelming if there are several
book projects going on.

An s-expression is a syntactically correct expression in LISP.  This notion also has a semantic side to it since s-expressions are used to express programming statements in LISP.  However, for the purpose at hand, the semantics does not interest us; we only care about the syntax in order to make sure that h-code can be properly read as input to the LISP programs we shall write to process h-code.

The basic syntax may be described by the following rules:

 <s-expression> -> <atom>

 <s-expression> -> ( <s-expression> )

 <s-expression> -> ( <s-expression> . <s-expression> )

 <s-expression> -> ' <s-expression>

Note: In a more complicated implementation (such as Common LISP) there may be more synatax rules than this basic set.

We're starting out some really basic research by talking about different
proposed rating systems in the [[file:PM.org][PM]] forums.  I rather like the idea of a
[[file:card-based temporary rating system.org][card-based temporary rating system]] that came up. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Mon Feb 7

Note that the card-based system described above does generate /permanent/ "reputations" for users. It is just temporary in the sense that the cards go away after a while. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

: Have you read [http://www.accelerando.org/book/ Accelerando]? I
go back to it for inspiration from time to time. It's kind of hard
to say what I digg about it. (One of my humble talents is /spotter/
and this rings my alarm.) Perhaps the limitless potentialities of
the future? It reminds me that I need two computers - one for biz and one for play, and maybe a third that never goes online /ever/. {ps: We don't have much time individually, I think, to equip, migrate and transform
ourselves for the rapidly accelerating oncoming train wreck that
is the future (esp. us Americans!) I wish for your continued success
in all of your endeavors.)

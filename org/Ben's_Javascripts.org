Here is a page to organize my javascripts and other ones I find useful, hopefully others can find them useful.

Here is a link to a greasemonkey script for blocking Google ad sense.  Remember use with 'caution' (i.e. only block sites you want to), the more ads we 'block' and don't use means a possibility of different advertising methods evolving or lost revenue for our favorite sites.

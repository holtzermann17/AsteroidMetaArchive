Just in case you thought software patents were completely irrelevant.  They aren't.  At least, not all of them.

* Discussion

Who knows if any of these would actually be enforced.  However, I'm
also pretty sure that this isn't the whole list.  These were
just obtained by searching for (1) "Xanadu"; (2) "theodor AND nelson".

Searching for "nelson AND hypertext" led to 256 patents.  (I'm not
sure if that is just a coincidence or a memory overflow.)  
Of course, some of these are bound to be irrelevant.

So, this all makes me wonder - how are these things enforced?  If
I distribute free software that someone things infringes on
their patent, do they tell me to cease and desist?  What about the
other people who might then distribute works based on mine?
Do I end up having to pay monetary damages?  Yikes!  

Do people maybe just get these patents for fun?  I kind of doubt it.
This is all sort of scary.  I don't think I've ever payed 
much attention to the software patent issue before... but it
is beginning to look like any reasonably big or interesting
program will infringe on many patents!  This seems to especially
be the case when the program has been basically described before
but not yet fully implemented.  I.e., you get a patent not for
a product but for a design.  Criminey.

The scenario you mentioned for enforcement sounds right to me.  I have read of at least one instance in which a representative from a large computer company would knock on the door of a small-time developer, pull out some patents from his briefcase, and demand that the developer pay license fees.  If the developer was not willing, the representative would pull out a few more patents until the developer would see that the only viable choices were to go out of business or pay the licensing fees.  The company's representative's message was that resistance is futile because it would cost more to challenge a patent in court than to pay the license fee and that, even if the defendant won, the company would simply turn around and sue for infringing another patent.  Pretty soon, this would bankrupt any small business.

I would say that the reason that people get these patents is not for fun, but for money.  On the one hand, it costs money to get a patent and defend it.  It costs several thousand dollars to obtain a patent and suing someone for infringement does not come for free either.  Therefore, only a big company is likely to have a portfolio of patents and patent lawyers on staff.  A private individual or small-time software house is only likely to be able to afford a few patents at best.  On the other hand, once one has a portfolio of patents, one can recover these costs and more by collecting licensing fees.

Of course, one of the victims of this state of affairs is free software.  If one has to pay licensing fees to release a program, how can one afford to give it away for free unless one already has a lot of money one is willing to part with?  For most people, the time spent in writing the free software is already a big enough sacrifice and having to pay license fees as well would be too much.  Even if one were willing and able to pay, a company might simply refuse to issue licenses for free implementation.  From the SCO business, one sees that the companies which engage in hoarding patents are no fans of free software.

Here is a link to an article by RMS on software patents; pretty much all of the reasons that they are bad come up for the scholium system, but this provides another point of view, taking literature as the hypothetical example: http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/comment/story/0,12449,1510566,00.html
It is therefore interesting to compare with the [[file:Ideas and Expression.org][Ideas and Expression]] page.  --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

A network of words, interestingly enough.

See http://wordnet.princeton.edu/. 
([http://wordnet.princeton.edu/license WordNet is free software.])
It is [http://wordnet.princeton.edu/doc documented online]
and with [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=8106 a book].

It has various interfaces and so on.  (I think it would be cool to write
an interactive browsing interface for [[file:Arxana.org][Arxana]].)

We know how to make copies of the main HDM archive, but it would be good to have
a clear set of instructions for how to make modifications and get them
incorporated into the main site.  --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Sun Jan 30 19:30:14 2005

Suppose you notice an error or omission in the HDM code.  For example, in
/~/hdm-site/prototype\ 3/100.tex/, the expression

  (defn irrational-number (x)
    (real x)
    (forall a b :in Z :st (neq q (/ a b))))

should say 

  (defn irrational-number (x)
    (real x)
    (forall a b :in Z :st (neq x (/ a b))))

We need to replace the /q/ with an /x/.  (We'll get to what to do if you
want to add a whole new file in a minute.)

* Changing things locally
** First, make a log

   % cd ~/wd/hello-world

   tla make-log
   ++log.hello-world--mainline--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-example

** Then make the update

Do what it says you're doing in the log entry.

Finally, type

  tla commit

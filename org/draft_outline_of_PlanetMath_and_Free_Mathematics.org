 * what do we mean by "free"?
  * ability to create/contribute knowledge as well as consume for no-cost
  * i.e. /libre/ free, not just /gratis/
  * notions of commons-based peer production (CBPP), free culture
 * talk about what planetmath *is* (now)
  * broad description: 
   * web site and virtual community for anyone interested in and/or doing mathematics
   * students (at all levels), teachers, researchers, amateurs, people in industry, ...
   * free (libre and gratis, with an emphasis on libre), GNU FDL license
   * history:      
    * dates back to 2001 (yes, even before Wikipedia!)
    * founders: Krowne, Egge, while undergrads at Virginia Tech
    * spurred by CRC's attack on MathWorld
    ** wanted convenient online reference
    ** needed quick production: collaborative system
    ** needed appropriate licensing (legal protection): FDL license
    * most coding: Krowne
    ** others contributed minority portions later (we would like to change this)
    * became Krowne's thesis project (at VT Digital Library lab for Master's)
  * overview of site
   * main section is encyclopedia
    * entries contributed spontaneously by users
    * written in LaTeX, rendered as HTML+images, page images, etc...
    * entries automatically inter-linked
    * third parties may submit corrections
    * authority model: 
    ** objects have an "owner" (starts as initial creator)
    ** ownership transferrable (voluntarily or due to outstanding corrections)
    ** owner can allow co-authors  
    ** good balance of facilitating production + respecting intellectual property
    * entries have types (definition, theorem, proof, etc)
    * entries can be attached (i.e. proof to theorem, example to definition, etc...)
    * organization by MSC (also used to facilitate autolinking)
    * searchable w/search engine (lucene-based)
   * requests section  
    * entries people want to see in the encyclopedia (any user can add)
    * some collaborative workflow for fulfilling requests 
   * also have books, papers, expositions sections 
    * also user-contributable
    * emphasize free and electronic resources
   * forums
    * bulletin-board style (threaded, configurable views)
    * attached to every major object
    * notification for posts, replies (configurable)
    * allow communication between learners, authors and readers
   * notification 
    * keep people integrated with relevant activity on the site
    * based on "watches"-- can be placed on most major objects (+msg threads)
    * web notices and email (configurable)
   * scores
    * used to keep track of productive activity
    * provide some recognition of contribution
    * encourage healthy competition
   * ... anything else?
  * studies and stats
   * system stats:
    * numer of entries (activity graphs)
    * edit/revision activity
    * number of users (all, active)
    * number of contributors (authors, correctors, posters, etc)
    * ... 
   * rmilson study
   * uptake of PM entries by Wikipedia

 * talk about the benefits of /libre/ free ("FIAF")
  * everyone knows whats so good about being digital/net-based and /gratis/ free (available everywhere, available to those without much money, lower overhead, etc.)
  * but, /libre/ CBPP affords:
   * massively-scalable economies of production
    * low barrier to contribution includes more people
   * high quality: "more eyes make errors shallow"
   * blur line between info consumer and producer:
    * "free culture" ideals: egalitarian, empowering
    * help students/learners/readers become true scholars
    * best way to learn is by teaching
   * avoid "lock-out" in publishing:
    * be judged by content, not credentials
    * minimize political effects
   * open review: reviewers subject to "review" themselves
    * review not coercive (convince, not force!)
    * review never stops (and why should it?)
   * high diversity/coverage of content:
    * review not a bottleneck
    * no page count/space limitations
   * ...      
 * talk about where we want to *go* with planetmath (and Noosphere)
  * "the home page for free math online"
  * want to branch out into all sorts of free math activites:
   * books (not just encyclopedic)
    * writing new books
    * scan in/OCR math books, start building upon them
   * general mathematical collaborations (papers/expositions) 
    * have collaborations section now
  * become more of a one-stop-shop collaborative digital library:
   * fold existing papers/expositions/books into a "DL" section
   * "syndicate" other sources: Ask Dr. Math, Math Atlas (Pitman), arXiv, ...
   * value-add for syndicated content, applying FIAF principles
  * be more pedagogical
   * learning object metadata, filtering, profiles
   * versions of entries for different audiences
   * more introductory/elementary content
   * more/many parallel classification interfaces
   * more figures/graphs/charts interactive apps (how to encourage?)
  * be more "credible"
   * encourage/support usage of real-world identities
   * tie publication (as in FEM) to credibility (i.e. motivate identities)
   * integrate explicit quality (ratings/reputations)
   * ...
  * work more with other collaborative sites
   * wikipedia, Ask Dr. Math, Atlas (Pitman), etc...
   * bi-directional updates of changes
  * HDM
   * computational/"actionable" math, using PlanetMath as "database"
   * integrate AI/machine learning aspects
   * actually enhance how mathematics is done 
  * do some studies to determine how to better serve the user community
  * spread Noosphere to other deployments 
   * already starting PlanetPhysics
   * soon: maybe PlanetComputing?     
  * ...
 * how you can help
  * using the site:
   * add entries
   * critique entries
   * participate in forums
  * encourage others to use it ("evangelism")
  * coding 
   * help add the things above and those on our TODO list
   * or just add features you want 
  * re-deploy Noosphere for other subjects
  * the .ORG of PM.org
   * overview description (nonprofit, 501(c)(3), Krowne prez, etc.)
   * financially supporting PM through the .ORG
   * sponsoring us
   * partnering with us
   * getting grants
  * help with planning and participate in "meta" discussions (go to AsteroidMeta)
 * conclude
  * something inspirational....

There have been a /lot/ of good suggestions (and probably some bad ones)
made over the years.

Someone with an eye for detail and a reasonably huge amount of time on their
hands should go back through the forums and organize the requests or
suggestions.

I would suggest possibly using a "better" knowledge representation medium
than AsteroidMeta, actually - maybe the 
[[file:A_scholium-based_document_model|scholium system.org][A_scholium-based_document_model|scholium system]], once it is complete.

(Indeed, we might CONSIDER porting our AM conversations to the scholium
system.  This thought should obviously be discussed on a different page.)

The task mentioned here is so potentially long, arduous, and helpful, that it should
probably be paid.

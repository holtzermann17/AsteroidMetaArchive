Seeing as how John !McCarthy is still alive and all,
maybe we should make an effort to get in touch with him.

Note that he mentions QED on his homepage.

: Perhaps when we make a tad more progress, it would be interesting to get his opinion of HDM and h-code.  As long as you've gotten opinions from Chomsky, Minsky and Stallman, !McCarthy's opinion would definitely be worth having alongside the opinions mentioned in the HDM guide.  Also, his chessboard example would make an excellent benchmark test for any theorem prover.  --[[file:rspuzio.org][rspuzio]] 3 April 2005

:: Maybe we should add points of interest (expected completion dates especially)
to the [[file:Schedule.org][Schedule]].  I agree that we're not quite ready yet - but it would be
nice to figure out what we'd have to do to be ready! --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Tue Apr 05 04:34:48 2005 UTC

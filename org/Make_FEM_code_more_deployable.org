I think it would be nice to use the FEM code to make a "big book"
containing all the documentation for the HDM project.  Ross has
some other highly-multiply-authored works that he has going on, too.
All in all, it would be pretty cool just to be able to drop something
derived from the FEM into a collection of !TeX files and say "go"
and have it spit out a compliation.  But porting to the HDM collection
would be a nice, simple, step.

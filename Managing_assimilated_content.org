Note that [[file:Managing unassimilated content.org][Managing unassimilated content]] isn't enough - we also will need to
organize the stuff that has been assimilated.  Maybe it can all be stored in a
giant unstructured database, but it could also be better to store it in a
structured database.  We'll just have to see, once we have more content.

(Also, content will always be at various stages of assimilation, so in some ways
assimilated content isn't so different from unassimilated content.)

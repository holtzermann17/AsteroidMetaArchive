Our master header file is months out of date.  A new one should be
built.

* Note
Keep careful track of the steps used to build the new header; perhaps
they can be made programmatic, or at least partially so, to speed
things along in the future.

* For the long-term...
We should get a system of shared header files in place on PM.
This way the local headers will not contain any surprises, and 
it will be much easier to work on the FEM.  Shared headers will
also make authoring PM easier.  I've already made some draft
headers, but again, those are months old.

* Status
I've written some code that produces the header automatically.  However,
the output can still be improved in several ways.  --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Sat Feb 19 18:38

Given the fact that I don't have a fully general !TeX parser, I think now the
file is about as good as it is going to get -- it certainly qualifies as being
an automatically generated header, and it is quite good enough to use as the
basis of a shared header system, which should probably be the next task.--[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Wed Feb 23 15:31:50 2005 UTC

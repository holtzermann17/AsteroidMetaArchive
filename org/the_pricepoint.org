Your only choice is as to when the future happens.

It is not going to happen without effort.  If you desire to
see the future, some of that effort may be yours.

If you are comfortable in the present (or go so far as to
hunger for the past), then most likely you'll ignore the
beckoning of the future; you'll arrive there one day, but
it won't look like anything special to you.  This is simple relativistic
dynamics.

Supposing, however, that you are interested in the future,
you can put your shoulder to the wheel.  If you're rich, you
can put your money where your mouth is.  If you haven't any
skills to speak of -- you can learn to do something useful.

There is always some sacrifice to make.

It's your choice.

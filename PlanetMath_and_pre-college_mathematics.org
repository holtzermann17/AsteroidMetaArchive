It would be easy to overlook the fact that many developing scholars
are still kids!

But PM provides a very special opporunity for people in the kid
age group.  Namely, they can interact with people from other age
groups & education levels, and "work at their own pace" in a way
that goes beyond even the very cool opportunities along these lines that folks like yours truly
found as a youngster.

However, PM's support for elementary math is rather weak right now.  It would be great to partner with people in the business of educating kids to help build this kind of content.

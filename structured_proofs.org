[http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#lamport-how-to-write /How To Write a Proof/ by Leslie Lamport] --- [http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html Lamport] is famous for !LaTeX, but seems quite a fan of formatting
for the sake of clarity.  In particular, the material presented here may be seen as an adaptation of his ideas to h-code.

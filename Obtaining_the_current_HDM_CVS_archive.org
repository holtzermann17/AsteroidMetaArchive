* Stand-alone stuff

The [[file:scholium system.org][scholium system]] is the thing I've been mainly working on for
the last year and a half; it is in the "scholium-system" subdirectory,
in the file sbdm4cbpp.tex.  Perhaps that's all you want, so here are
links to a stand-alone [http://planetmath.org/~jcorneli/sbdm4cbpp.pdf PDF]
and [http://planetmath.org/~jcorneli/sbdm4cbpp.tex TeX] files
with the relevant content.

(The file sbdm4cbpp.tex contains code that runs in [[file:Emacs.org][Emacs]], as well
as documentation that formats nicely with !LaTeX, as you can see in
the PDF file.)

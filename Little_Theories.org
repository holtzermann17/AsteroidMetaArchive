The [[file:IMPS.org][IMPS]] system popularized the concept of "little theories," the principle that axiomatic systems
should be small and modular, and that individual theorems should use only the axioms they truly need,
rather than having a monolithic One True Axiomatization for all theorems in the universe. A very
accessible presentation of the ideas is the 1992
[http://imps.mcmaster.ca/doc/little-theories.pdf Little Theories] paper by William Farmer et al.

These ideas are very similar to the motivations behind the [[file:Ghilbert.org][Ghilbert]] module system. Thanks are due
to [[file:marnix.org][marnix]] for pointing out this connection.

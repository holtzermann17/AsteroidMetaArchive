: "Love me or hate me, it's still an obsession" -- Lady Sovereign, 2006

* Arxana

Arxana is a content management and hypertext editing platform, based
on the idea of robust and universal annotation.

Arxana can do a number of useful things the current [[file:Noösphere.org][Noösphere]]
can't do.  However, the reverse is also true (for now).  Our current development
objective is to bridge the gaps between these two systems, and in so
doing, prepare Arxana for full-scale deployment.

The current development version of the system is available for
preliminary testing, experimentation, and constructive criticism.

For a quick "tech notes"-style summary of where this project is at right now (as of Dec 18, 2006),
see [[file:Arxana overview.org][Arxana overview]]!

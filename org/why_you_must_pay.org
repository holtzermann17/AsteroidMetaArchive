There are those of us who will pay very dearly in hope of reaping even greater rewards.
There are those of us who will wait and hope to pay later, or hope to freeride.

But everyone pays.  

If you wait to pay later, you don't know the price; furthermore, you
don't know what you might be missing in terms of fun and excitement
and personal choice along the way (because although those who work
hard suffer, they also laugh from time to time).

You must build your own future.  Freight trains don't take no
gamblers, no midnight ramblers like they did before.  You want to ride
the train, you have to pay the price.

You may pay in blood, sweat, tears, or with your firstborn.  But you
must pay.

For if you don't pay, you will have to pay with your life.

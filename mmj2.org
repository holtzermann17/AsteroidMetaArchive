Design info uploaded for new GMFF enhancement
proposal. UPDATED w/info about the Model files
for GMFF...plus tweaked versions of syl.html
in the \html and \althtml directories.

Let me know what you think!

See the README.html file in

New version of mmj2 uploaded: Release 20110701!

http://us2.metamath.org:8888/ocat/mmj2/mmj2.zip

*  3.6MB

Refer to mmj2\CHGLOG.TXT in the mmj2.zip downwload
for a description of the changes. 

The mmj2\README.html file also contains valuable contact
information for mmj2 support, including info about logging
onto this wiki as an editor.

A few interesting topics :-)

- You can now support mmj2 development with monetary donations 
via Paypal to siskiyousis at gmail.com! Continuing 
maintenance and new enhancements (Jan 2012?) are
time-consuming and way more than 1000 hours of work
have already been invested in mmj2.

- The new release contains mmj2\data\mm\RegressionTest1set.mm
which is a snapshot of the 20-Aug-2008 set.mm. This file will
be used for regression testing of new software releases going
forward. The problem this solves is that over time a large
number of symbols and statement labels in set.mm change and
updating the mmj2 test data to match is too much work.

- Since 2008 the number of symbols and statements in set.mm
have increased by enough to justify increasing memory
allocations in the mmj2.bat file. A Total Memory size of
128MB and a Maximum Memory equal to 256MB are specified.

mmj2 is an open source software package for use with [[file:metamath.org][metamath]]
(.mm) databases. It is written in Java and provides both batch
(command line) and GUI capabilities. Its most notable feature
is the mmj2 Proof Assistant GUI, which provides support for
Metamath proof development and is perhaps easier to use than
the metamath.exe proof assistant (note: power users benefit from
using both proof assistants simultaneously, and employ the 
Metamath eimm.exe utility to transfers proofs between the
two proof assistants.)

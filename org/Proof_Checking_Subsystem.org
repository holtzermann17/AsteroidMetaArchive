Mainly wanted to check in about plans for the deployment
of the [[file:template utilities.org][template utilities]].  How will they be used here?
What are the easy test problems, and, to the extent we can
know it now, what's the long term plan for becoming general?

Do we need any AI to make proofchecking work?  My sense is
no, the proof checker
will take some [[file:hcode.org][hcode]] and run with it.  It will be
the job of the AI (eventually, humans at first) to assemble
proofs.  But the AI should certainly be able to read and
utilize the output of the proofchecker. (Probably that won't be
hard.)

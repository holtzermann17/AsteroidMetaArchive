This is a(n annotated) bibliography of pages having to do with bibliographies.

[http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/index.html  The Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies] is, contains, links to, or is otherwise a variant of, the [http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/Misc/HBP/  Hypertext Bibliography Project]
which claims to be managed by David M. Jones, and to offer a set of crossreferenced bibliographies 
(for example a bibliography of the [http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~jacm/ Journal of the ACM]).

I'd be curious to know what people think of this project and other related projects (and
how these two topics might relate).

I think it would be great if we could organize a (sponsored) meet-up for people
working on "this stuff" (i.e. the stuff we do).  The place that comes to mind
for me when I think about this sort of thing is MSRI, but I recognize that a lot
of what we do isn't that mathematical.

Anyway, I think it would be great if we could organize some workshops, or
Bourbaki-like "congresses", or Adobe-like hacking sessions, or what have you.
It would be cool if in the process we met some new people and got some work
done.

This is just a glimmer of an idea right now, but I think it is something we
could easily come up with details about, and ask someone with money to sponsor,
at some point.

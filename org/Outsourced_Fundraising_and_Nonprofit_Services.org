As PM (and other AM projects) are operating with very low overhead, it makes sense to try
to outsource the operation of fundraising and other nonprofit services (for example, all
the management of membership).

We should go through the list here: http://www.nonprofits.org/npofaq/misc/990804olfr.html and
try to figure out which services show promise for application to PM (or other AM projects), 
listing candidates here.

Special weight should go to services that:

 * have low or no start-up costs or maintenance fees
 * have low or no commissions
 * have easy to use, web-based management and reporting interfaces
 * are easy to embed functionally in our web sites

*  The problem

Noosphere contains as its core feature a section called the "encyclopedia".  It
consists of interlinked expository entries, written in LaTeX.  However, it
appears that "encyclopedia" is a poor name for this thing.  The key reasons are
that Noosphere supports knowledge communities, which are much more than "an
encyclopedia", and that even "the encyclopedia" itself isn't much like what is
classically envisioned when people use this term.

Some ways in which the general site/software isn't an encyclopedia:

 * It supports a user population.
 * It contains discussion forums (external to the encyclopedia).
 * It has other facilities for users to interact (like site mail).
 * It has blog-like news functionality.
 * It contains sections for other types of content objects (books, papers, expositions).
 * It contains facilities (like the requests list) to update the encyclopedia but which are external to it.

Some ways in which "the encyclopedia" really isn't:

 1. Its interlinked.
 1. It contains, and places a high emphasis, on all kinds of
  contextually-appropriate attachments to a node.  For mathematics, the types
  that go beyond the "vanilla" encyclopedia types (topic, theorem, definition)
  are results, examples, proofs, and more (in fact, one might argue that a true
  encyclopedia would only contain "topic" entries --- however, specialized
  encyclopedias in some subject domain typically get more granular.)
 1. It allows and encourages discussion of encyclopedia nodes.
 1. It is fundamentally collaborative (therefore has things like corrections).
 1. It is changing continuously.
 1. It comes with its own change history (including history of corrections).
 1. There are no strict mechanisms for control of coverage.

Initially I thought there would be little to no harm in co-opting this term to
define Noosphere's main section.  However, now I think it is causing serious
harm, because it seems to be limiting and altering people's conceptions of what
Noosphere should be and what activity should take place within Noosphere sites.

*  The solution (Rename the section)

I think the best thing to do is simply re-name the section.  Here are some
starter ideas:

 * knowledge base (for PM, perhaps "mathbase")
 * knowledge tree (for PM, "Mathematical Knowledge Tree".  courtesy of rspuzio).
 * knowledge network
 * concept network
 * hyperpedia
 * noosnet / noosbase
 * ... please suggest more!

I am leaning toward "knowledge base", since it is pretty clear that knowledge in
some form is being stored in some other form, yet there is little restriction on
either the type of knowledge or its format.  Variants with the term "network", I
think, lead to confusion with computer networks.  And of course, "noosphere" is
a nice way to describe a shared concept space, but there is potential for
confusion with the software itself, and reducing this abstract term to a
specific manifestation is unwieldy.  Also, "noos" is hard to say and cumbersome

*  Discussion

What do you think?  Please help!  A good name is important for both understanding and promotion!

----

"Knowledge Base", to me, typically means something that is computer-friendly.
But PM is human friendly.  Even "concept network" is stretching it as a /name/
for the resource (though as a way to think about the resource it could be just
fine).

I personally think that "Encyclopedia" is a fine name for the part
of the site that is currently called "Encyclopedia".  In terms of
"publicity" stuff, I think you are /quite right/ that discussion
of the special advantages of [[file:Noosphere.org][Noosphere]] and PM are in order.

But I think people accept the "Encyclopedia" aspect of PM /as/ an Encyclopedia
-- which I think it is.  The special and "extra" things about PM are not an
encyclopedia.  

So, I would suggest focus on describing these features, which do, or anyway,
should, describe the site as a whole.  No "Encyclopedia" that I know of has
papers, books, expositions and traditional articles all linked together -- and
this seems to be something that would "go beyond" the meaning of the word
"Encyclopedia" more than any of the things you cited (to my sensibilities).

If you extend what happens in the encyclopedia to the rest of the site, the
result might well need a new name.

I kind of like "hyperpedia" - and this /could/, I think, describe the expanded
document.  But then you'd have both an Encyclopedia and a Hyperpedia, and that
might be confusing for some.

Personally, I guess I think that "Encyclopedia" is a fine name for that
section... and if anything needs more description, it might be NÃ¶osphere.  (Of
course, we could call the encyclopedia a "Noeopedia" -- which would be accurate
and rather nice, but unfortunately, people might get scared by all those
vowels.)

Anyway... I think the features are what are important, much more so than the
name.  If the BPE was revised, then I think we could call the whole thing a
"Digital Library" and call the Encycopedia the "Reference Section" ;).

I agree, The Encyclopaedia on PlanetMath (w. capital E) is a good name. 
The average user will talk about Planetmath, anyway. Anyone who
vists will get the idea. The only disadvantage is that it is a long name and 
difficult to spell (greek). On the other hand, exactly that might give it a 
more "authority". --[[file:matte.org][matte]] 27 April 2005

I agree with [[file:akrowne | Aaron.org][akrowne | Aaron]] that the choice of name has psychological implications and that choosing a novel name can help people to think outside the box.  While the term encyclopaedia is a reasonable term to describe what is found there insofar as it is an attempt to account for the whole of mathematical knowledge, unforunately the term suggests that this website is meant to be like already existing encyclopaedias in other ways as well.

However, this work differs in two fundamental ways: 1. While conventional encyclopaedias are linearly ordered, this work is organized in a more complicated way using hyperlinks.  (In particular, the traditional linear order is an option, but definitely not the only way of viewing the work.)  2. While conventional encyclopedias are static, this work is dynamic.

These differences are primarily due to the nature of media.  Condition 1 is imposed by the nature of ink-on-paper writing (and is ultimately a relection of the linear nature of spoken language) but is lifted by computerized hypertext.  To be sure, one can include cross-references, but these still require the reader to turn the page, so do not go quite as far as their electronic counterparts.  Condition 2 is imposed in a rather sever form by the nature of printing.  It takes a large effort to typeset a book and this effort is only worthwhile if hundreds of copies are to be printed and there is no practical way to make changes once the typesetting is under way other than adding errata slips.  Thus one must regard works to be printed as essentially static.  However, with computers, one can easily type in changes on an ongoing basis.  As long as backups are available, there is little danger in this practise.

Unfortunately, after 500 years of printing, the results of these limitations of the technology have become so familiar that people take the them for granted as the way things are done and it takes a considerable mental effort to unlearn these habits of thought and make full use of the capabilities which hypertext offers.  Sticking to the terminology of the printed era can reinforce this mental inertia and make it harder for people to realize that the constraints which were imposed by earlier technology no longer exist.  Using new terms alerts people to the fact that something is radically different and helps break up outdated thought patterns by not reinforcing existing associations.

As [[file:jcorneli | Joe.org][jcorneli | Joe]] points out, simply changing terms will do nothing --- there certainly are enough cases of stale old wine in new bottles (or in the same bottles with different labels).  In fact, if one does not make an effort to make something new, new terminology can be downright misleading.  However, I do not see that being the case here.  Rather, what Planet Math has to offer is fundamentally different from a printed encyclopaedia, but people are having a hard time adjusting to the new features.  One sees users semi-consciously perpetuating practises from the world of print which are no longer relevant here.  The parable of the monastery cat which  [[file:drini | Drini.org][drini | Drini]] once suggested is relevant here.

My proposal for a new name would be "Tree of Mathematical Knowledge".  The rationale behind this proposal is that it emphasizes the new features.  The term "tree" suggests a non-linear branched structure which is how Planet math is organized.  A tree is a living organism which grows and changes, suggesting the dynamic nature of this resource.
--[[file:rspuzio.org][rspuzio]] 27 April 2005

Oooh, the "tree" idea is really neat.  I see it being shortened in places to
"knowledge tree" or "math knowledge tree".  I'll add this to the
list. --[[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]] Wed Apr 27 19:45:31 UTC 2005

I don't like the "tree" idea.  IMO, knowledge isn't very tree-like - and, less
metaphysically, the idea that PM is organized as a tree is misleading.  "Web"
might be somewhat better than tree.

But it also seems potentially misleading to say that PM is a <anything> of
knowledge, because it doesn't contain "pure knowledge"; it simply contains
writing (in hypertext, but so what?).

There is no law that says you can't have a "hypertext encyclopedia", just like
there is no law that says you can't have a "hieroglyphic encyclopedia" or a
"filmic encyclopedia".  When thinking about names, /my advice is to avoid
getting caught get caught up in what words usually denote, and think instead
about their etymologies/.  Etymologically, "encyclopedia" seems to work fine -
and indeed, it seems like a good goal for PM's encyclopedia to become more
"encyclopedic".

More interesting to me than the debate over the name would be some of the questions
that it raises.   For example:

 1. what habits "from the world of print" people are carrying around with them?
 1. how can we encourage behavior that better suits the medium?
 1. how should we descibe/name the "knowledge community" on PM? -- which I'll
happily grant is a new sort of thing.

--[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Wed Apr 27 21:14:54 2005 UTC

I agree that "web" would be a bit more accurate, but there is the practical matter
that this term has been co-opted, and for a confusingly close context.  

Actually, "web" doesn't really express the "living" nature that "tree" does, and I 
think this is a useful aspect of PM to highlight.

I don't agree what you said about thinking of etymologies all the time.  Etymologies
are obscure things that normal people should be able to get by entirely without (I'm
not denying that they can sometimes come in handy, though).  For typical use of 
language, one should only need context and semantics.

Besides, to command people to switch to an etymological interpretation is to argue 
that "the world is wrong", not us.  That is a battle that is not worth fighting.  

What it comes down to, I think, is whether it would be more clear to re-define 
"encyclopedia" or to come up with a new term.  Both will be semantically laborious
to some extent, but I think "encyclopedia" is somewhat jarring.

Your questions are good, but here are some simple answers:

 1. For example, people seem to carry with them the classical encyclopedic expectation
that something can't go in PM's collection unless "everyone agrees on it".  But in reality,
this never happens, you just have that one party or the other asserts control over the
final copy.  We don't need to do that on PM (the site --- doing it in the FEM is fine!)
 1. Well we could start by not naming our core service something which it is not =)
 1. I have no problem naming it "knowledge community".  Maybe you'd rather it be called 
an "encyclopedia community"? =)

Finally, I have a problem with your point about the "pure knowledge" vs. "mere writing" 
distinction.  I think this blurs a useful distinction between information and information
which is written and encoded for /ease of learning/.  And I think the hypertext
is one of our extra-encyclopedic features that facilitates the learning of PM, hardly a
"so what".   In fact, I'd say that there is a profound similarity between knowledge
in-people's-heads and external information which is /highly organized and integrated/.
In a sense, this is just what your brain does with information that makes it "true"
knowledge.  I think knowledge bases like PM (beneficially) exert effort to do something 
similar.

--[[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]] Thu Apr 28 00:19:54 UTC 2005


And maybe "education community" would work -- getting back to a point you made
earlier to me (by email).  But "knowledge community" is also good.  (And it
spreads the weight evenly over knowledge creation, knowledge exposure, knowledge
assimilation, etc., all of which are part of PM, I think.)  "Knowledge
ecosystem" or "information ecosystem" would also describe the living nature of
the site (and probably do a better job than "tree" in certain respects).

As for the "pure knowledge" vs. "writing" issue, what I'd say is that no written
resource can become pure knowledge; it will always be "writing" - but that
doesn't make it "mere".  ("And God said, let there be light, and there was
light.")

I objected to "knowledge base" because traditionally, knowledge bases are
actionable in some sense.  I think PM is on its way to becoming actionable, and
hypertext helps, clearly, but it does not suffice.  I also think PM is becoming
increasingly well written, and increasingly oriented towards ease of learning.
But I don't think I would call it a "knowledge base" until we have software that
actually uses it as a knowledge base.  (It is a fluke of tradition that having
people use it as a knowledge base "doesn't count"; etymology alone would
probably say that the usage is fine.)

As for "the world is wrong" - maybe I just don't spend much time thinking about
what the world thinks.  If the world thinks that an encyclopedia is something
that one finds on a (dusty) shelf in the reference section of a library, OK.
Maybe they /are/ wrong.  Maybe not.  Does it matter?

It is my opinion that PM's encyclopedia /is/ an encyclopedia, and a good (and
increasingly good) one at that.  Am I wrong?  Does it matter?

(You may also find "dictionary" in HDM to be jarring.  In this case, I enjoy
taking the old word and giving it new life in a new context.  If it ends up
making people think twice about "what is a dictionary?" then I'll probably be
happy.  Indeed, "HDM" is designed to confuse people & make them think twice or
thrice or more.)

The "world-of-print habit" of requiring agreement might not be so bad.  E.g., it
might be good that APM-Xi isn't in the PM encyclopedia.  (Here, however, I think
that the relevant way to improve PM is already understood, and is fairly high
tech: make parallel collections.)

In general, we need to work on making both technology and culture that further
the goals we have for the site.  (And culture may be just another technology.)
Using aposite words to describe the site and portions thereof would have some
cultural benefits.  But let's not lose sight of the forest for the trees :).
--[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Thu Apr 28 03:16:18 2005 UTC

OK, how 'bout this idea to describe PM: "Learning community".  /This/ 
captures the things I like about "education community" w/o some of the stuff
I don't like, and it has a good bilingual (English-Greek) pun, in that
"mathematics" is "learning", and finally, it can also be said "community of
learning", which is, I think, an idiom of sorts.  See http://www.princeton.edu/~cbli/ for "Community Based Learning Initiative",
and http://www.virginialearning.org/index2.htm for "Virgina's Community of Learning". --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

You can call PM "learning community" if you like.  But I started this page to
discuss what to call the encyclopedia section, not the entire site.  Getting back
to that, you may have a point as to "knowledge base" typically being actionable.  I 
didn't think this was a requirement or expectation, but this is at least an empirical
question.  On the other hand, I like "knowledge tree" even more, so its not really 
a relevant question.

Oh by the way, when I explain HDM to people, I call it a /database/, not a 
/dictionary/ (sorry??).  I think they understand it much better for it and it 
makes it easier for me to explain.   But I do always mention that the precise form
 of the acronym isn't important.  --[[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]] Thu Apr 28 15:26:46 UTC 2005

OK, I think I just /might/ call PM a "learning community", so watchout!

I can't really argue about "knowledge tree" any more.  (I've designated
http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Tree.html as my proxy for any further
discussion of this term.)

You can call HDM a database, I don't mind that (because it is accurate).  In the
past, I myself have substituted "database" for "knowledge base", to the dismay
of some AI people who feel that there is a big/important difference.  But I
don't think the difference is so important.

To me, "dictionary" seems to be a beautiful term to use -- the idea of a
structure that explains the meaning of every contained term & concept is exactly
what I'm after.  The possibility for unlimited refactoring, and self-explanatory
text at any level is implicit (for me) in the conjunction of "hyperreal" and
"dictionary".

I'm sure one could raise the same objections against "dictionary" that I've been
raising against "tree" or you've been raising against "encyclopedia" -- namely
that the datastructure is wrong.  But my thought is that it isn't: a dictionary
is not a lookup-table, it is a hypertextual document (even if it appears in
print form) that, at least in theory, reduces a lexicon -- or even a whole
language -- by a more or less complex process, to its fundamental defining
terms, whatever those may be, and also provides some useful "ideational
landmarks" on the way up or down.  Sure, your day-to-day English dictionary may
do a somewhat crummy job at this, but we're only human, after all - and the
better dictionaries do a pretty good job!  The idea of a dictionary is a very
powerful thing, but the power has yet to be completely realized in any
existing implementation.  (Accordingly, I do think that if you say "database" to
describe HDM, you should also say "together with tools for interacting with the
database", because this is where most of the "power" lies.)

But - yes - back to the "encyclopedia": just like HDM makes "transformative use"
of the term "dictionary", I think that PM can (and does) make transformative use
of the term "encyclopedia".  If I was to take PM's use of the term & try to come
up with a synonym, I think I'd start with

  PM Encyclopedia : HDM ::~ text : code

In other words, the PM Encyclopedia is expository text, whereas HDM is just code
(which may at some point be used for generating expository text, via some of
as-yet-unwritten "tools").  If dictionaries are code for understanding written
text, then perhaps the proposed analogy says that encyclopedias contain text to
be understood.  If HDM is a "database", "codebase", or "knowledgebase", then
maybe the PM encyclopedia is a "textbase".  Another more common term for this is
"library" -- but an encyclopedia is different from a library in that the former
summarizes and overviews things you might find in the full library.  If I'm
allowed to use one of my favorite "Joeisms", then I might say that PM
Encylopedia is a "summary-overview of mathematics".  But what is this?  Perhaps
the best word is SYNOPTICON -- like Carr's "Synopsis of Elementary Results in
Pure and Applied Mathematics", or like the Synopticon described here

: The Synopticon comprises a new kind of reference work - accomplishing for
ideas what the dictionary accomplishes for words and the encyclopaedia
accomplishes for facts. (http://www.angelicum.net/html/great_books_set.html)

Indeed, at one point I thought about using this term to describe HDM - but that
was before I really understood the concept of a map covering the territory.

So, we've reach base camp in our ascent; to summit, we'll need an appropriate
modifier.

  X : PM synopticon ::~ hyperreal : HDM dictionary

Well, at first blush, this seems not too difficult: we can supply
"collaborative" (like the [[file:GCIDE.org][GCIDE]]) or go one step further and use "commons"
like in "commons-based peer production".  If you want a neologism, how about
"synopticommons"?  But IMO, the PM Collaborative Synopticon of Mathematics is a
little better.  You could also use the PM Common Synopticon of Mathematics --
nice, because like the "D" in "HDM", people have some options about how to
interpret the acronym.
--[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Thu Apr 28 17:43:19 2005 UTC

Or PM Common/Collaborative Synopsis of Mathematics (which may have a bit of a
better flow than Common/Collaborative Synopticon). --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Thu Apr 28 17:57:53 2005 UTC

But "synopticon" rolls off the tongue better - you can just say, the "PM
Synopticon" and people would know what you were talking about (more or less).

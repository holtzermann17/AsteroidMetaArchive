All text on PM (forums, corrections) have automatically generated hyperlinks 
for www pages. Unfortunately, this is not true for requests. 
This would be particularly useful as one can point out related entries in the request. 

See for example [http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj;from=requests;id=527].

(You should sign your edits) A major edit is one you'd like to show up in the "recent 
changes" list, basically (this should be most, or "normal" edits).  A minor edit would be
for things that don't need to clutter the default "recent changes" display (like fixing
a typo). --[[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]] Mon Jun 20 22:38:18 UTC 2005

: Thanks. I know edits should be signed, I just forgot about it that time. Is it alright to sign only with the date? I get a headache trying to figure out what time is over there all the time...

:: Sure, that's how I do it.  There is no particular reason to add the time -- in fact I think that the only reason that the time shows up is that these people use a computer program which automatocally adds the time.  The only important thing is to sign with your name. --[[file:rspuzio.org][rspuzio]]

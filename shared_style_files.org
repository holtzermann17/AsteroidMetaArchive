It would be convenient for everyone involved if a set of standard style files
was used on [[file:PM.org][PM]].  This would make notation consistent throughout the site,
and would prevent lots of potential !LaTeX errors when we go to combine the
various entries in the [[file:FEM.org][FEM]].  

I think it would be ideal if people always added new definitions to these
central files, though a more liberal approach would allow a mixture of standard
style file inclusions and ad hoc definitions in the file itself.  We can talk
more about the relative merits of these two approaches.

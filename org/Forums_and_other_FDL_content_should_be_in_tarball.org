I'm not clear on whether or not the FDL requires that the messages that were
posted in the forums are included in a tarball... probably just having the
various webpages up is sufficient.  However, given the fact that the messages,
like all other contributions to the site, are FDL'ed, and the fact that someone
somewhere might have their life improved by having this stuff made available for
speedy download, I think all the content should be made available in some huge
tarballs.  Forums, corrections, anything else that is public.  I guess that
PlanetMath mail is not subject to FDL terms, but this is not clear from the
disclaimer that one signs at the time of registration.  This needs to be
investigated and fixed up if necessary, too. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Fri Feb  4 00:50:16 2005

#+STARTUP: showeverything logdone
#+options: num:nil

The first version this a program was designed as a prototype system for
converting logic expressed as h-code into the more usual midfix notation and
typesetting it.  On that head, so far, only sentential logic is supported, but
predicates will come soon.  

Shortly after this version was written, a parser that could turn the !TeX code
back into h-code was added.  


Future versions should support more !TeX and more h-code; hopefully the code for
the two directions of translation will stay roughly in synch with one another.
Also, in future versions there may be some be better documentation.

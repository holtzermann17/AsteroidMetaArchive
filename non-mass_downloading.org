One should be able to download and upload individual PM pages.

This is really essential for productive use of the site.

/PM should be put into CVS./  

Note that AsteroidMeta pages can be downloaded and edited using the
`simple-wiki-mode' for Emacs.  It would be great to set up facilities for doing
basically the same thing for PM.  

But CVS would of course be super, independently of anything like that. For one
thing, it would remove the need to download huge tarballs when only a few files
have changed, for example.  Furthermore, I'm not sure that the same features
that are procesed by `simple-wiki-mode' are "exposed" by PM.

Note that I can't even upload content to the encyclopedia using the lynx
browser!  More work should be done on making the PM interface transparent
to computers.  CVS would be a good first step

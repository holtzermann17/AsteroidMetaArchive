This is a very interesting import store located in Roanoke, Virginia.  It is operated by a collaboration between two churches in Roanoke and sells traditionally crafted objects from the Binaba, Ghana.

This is significan in several ways.  One of the churches is an Episcopal church with mostly white members.  The other church has mostly black members.  Therefore, this is shop can be seen as the descendants of slaves and of slaveowners coming together in an effort to help repair the damages of colonialism (all the proceeds from sales go to help the village of Binaba).

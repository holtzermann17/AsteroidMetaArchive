I've got tired of writing "the scholium system" every time I wanted
to refer to /the scholium system/, and when through a little wordplay
i stumbled upon the nick-name /arxana/, i thought, wow! - this is
good!

The name Arxana is a multiple pun (which itself is a meta-pun, of course, since
the multiple meanings and allusions are like scholia attached to the string itself).
If the name is new to you, then I'll leave the details as an exercise. :)

The [http://www.emacswiki.org EmacsWiki] people have a spam repository
that we've been using here on AM to filter out attack-spam.  Obviously
it is only a partial solution, but I would like to make sure that we are
using this resource as effectively as possible.  It would be good to
have the spam-reporting mechanism down -- so instead of just deleting
spam HTML links, people around here would actually prevent those particular URLs
from becoming spam again (on this wiki and on others).  

One other thought: I guess we should all be reading the RecentChanges
page with minor changes included, because that seems to be the route
by which spammers mess us up.  

Ideally it would be possible to just one-click delete and report spam.
After I understand the situation a little better, maybe I can make
a handy spam-blaster tool in emacs.

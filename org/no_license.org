This is not really a proposal for a license for PM. However, typically lecture notes, thesis, etc. are posted on homepages with no license at all. Can anyone say what the "user rights" for these are? Printing?  --[[file:matte.org][matte]]

The default assumption under (U.S.) law is currently "all rights reserved", so the 
user has few rights beyond the rights to read these pages and fair use. --[[file:rspuzio.org][rspuzio]]

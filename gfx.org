Hi gfx, please make a little blurb here telling us something about yourself
and add an appropriate link to the [[file:Users.org][Users]] page.  Thanks! --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]
: Oh , gfx = drini, it's just that I was at a place I didnt' want my IP to be disclosed due to personal reasons, and I wasn't sure if this wiki shows ips within edit histories (like wikipedia does) so I took a temporary pen name, but after check I've seen it's not the case. --[[file:drini.org][drini]]

It discloses IP's only if you don't sign edits!  So, its a good thing you signed with something :) --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

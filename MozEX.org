Welcome to the coolest Firefox extension yet. This will allow you to do arbitary
things when click, say, a mailto: link ... or even edit text boxes!

** Caveats
When you're specifying the subject, %s might be an empty string (in fact, it
will be from most URLs). Placing it in quotes forces it to allocate a command
argument, or shell word, so as not to confuse mutt with <tt>-s toaddress</tt>.

Have they updated this yet?  Last I installed it (and rspuzio as well), it was broken
in latest firefoxes, and you had to hack prefs.js to get it working.

Incidentally, it makes a cool pairing with PM or ResearchCollab for editing text boxes in
your favorite TeX-based editor. --[[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]] Fri Mar 10 02:30:47 UTC 2006

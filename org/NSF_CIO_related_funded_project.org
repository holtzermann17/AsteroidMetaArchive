[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0537341 1] - 
thinking about how to use cyberinfrastructure for research,

[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0537389 2] -
teaching people about re-use,

[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0534113 3] - this group [http://www.globus.org/ Globus] is working on
improved software for sharing "computing power, databases, instruments, and other on-line tools securely across corporate, institutional, and geographic boundaries without sacrificing local autonomy.",

[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0515491 4] - integrating
batch computing with a database management system, relates to functional
scholium system,

[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0453438 5] - a new REU
for networking, which is interesting as a case in point for funding an educational
program, maybe not so much for this year, but perhaps for a future application for
the Open School/NCT start-up funding, especially if the current grant is 
successful,

[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0520036 6] - a group
that's mainly doing "outreach" stuff,

[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0438300 7] - 
context-aware distributed programs -- presumably we would 
want to have something like this, eventually,

[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0438314 8] - a
scalable distributed information management system,

[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0438443 9] - BOINC,
a follow-up to Seti@Home,

[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0441095 10] - improved
network-interconnection in the Americas - not too closely related in
and of itself, except to think about how we will be promoting 
people-interconnection over the network,

[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0504261 11] - another
metaphorically applicable award, this time a "self-managing distributed network",
interesting in terms of thinking about how we would deal with our own metaphorical
"worms",

[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0438385 12] - a
project about sharing information, but interestingly, focused on keeping some
information from being shared too broadly!,

[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0426021 13] - 
explanatory visualization: mainly just a cool project, eventually it would
be great to have pictures like these folks make integrated into the learning
resources we provide; interesting, also, to think about breaking up a discussion
into scholia as a sort of (initially) text-based "visualization" of the
underlying structure of the discussion,

[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0329756 14] &
[http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0330538 15] - two
projects concerning "middleware", showing how important this stuff is.  Makes
me think that "Grid Computing" as a elegantly-weilded metaphor may prove
to be useful for us.

Finding just the right calendar/"issue tracker"/"workflow manager" seems
tricky.  Here are some things I've noticed so far:

 * trac looks a little heavy-duty for our needs, but has some good attributes
 * http://www.taskjuggler.org/docs.php for Gantt charts and more
 * really simple, but maybe too simple http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~pelzlpj/wyrd/ (but
comes with a great Flash demo!)  It's neat to see/show what can be done with simple tools.

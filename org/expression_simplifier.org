Note that the expression parser currently does a lot of "simplifications"
(e.g. will transform 1+2+3+4+5 into (+ 1 2 3 4 5), instead of
(+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 (+ 4 5)))), the latter being the parse you might
expect to see from the simplest sort of parser.  It isn't immediately
clear to me that these sorts of simplifications can't be avoided,
but maybe they can, in which case, the parser could be simplified quite
a bit if a post-processor did the simplification routines on the
hcode parse.  Also, Kyle wrote the beginnings of such a simplifier, see [[file:JACKYL.org][JACKYL]].

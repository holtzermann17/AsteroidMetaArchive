An atom is not necessarily in a list of course; they are just the
elements of the set /S/ you were talking about in the [[file:list.org][list]]
entry.

Also, in lisp you can have atoms like 

   atom.helium'

I don't know exactly what the limits are, but I would think that
the only rule is that the atoms can contain parens, or /be equal to/ one of quote, quasiquote, or period.  There may be more to it, lots
of little rules that I don't understand.  I'm not sure, for example, why

  't

is an atom, but emacs says it is.  Also, different Lisps are probably
going to have slightly different ideas of what is an atom and what is not.

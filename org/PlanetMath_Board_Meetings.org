This page is for coordinating and recording PlanetMath.org board meetings.   Each meeting gets its own page, linked off from here.

We plan to hold the board meetings approximately quarterly.  They will be announced a few weeks in advance, both to board members
and the community at large (using the planetmath.org web site).

Um, hi, so, let's coordinate, 'K? --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

Even though this page wasn't used, I think we did a pretty good job coordinating by using the website as a whole for our discussions.  Reflecting on the nature of the contributions, I would say that they seem reasonably well coordinated.  When we talked about several rather similar topics such as CBPP (and PM in specific) we approached them form different viewpoints --- you considered the technical aspects of annotation, Robert considered the pedagogical value, I considered the legal aspects, and Aaron is considering cultural aspects.  Taken together, these provide a well rounded view of the same phenomenon from different angles.

I think it would be nice if all the tasks appeared on one page, in a table
format showing what project they were associated with and who was working on
them.  In general, for optimum task management, we'd probably want something
more powerful than a wiki engine.  But we should see what we can do with what we
have (and the various extensions available for Oddmuse).

* Update

I have achieved something like the above, see [[file:Tasks.org][Tasks]].  The only missing piece
is linkback for users who are working on a certain task.  But we can do this by
hand pretty easily. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]] Mon Feb 14 19:43:29 2005

And see also [[file:the relative merits of wiki and other workflow management media.org][the relative merits of wiki and other workflow management media]].

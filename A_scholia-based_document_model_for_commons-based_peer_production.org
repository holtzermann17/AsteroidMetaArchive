** Document Abstract

Commons-based peer production is a term that describes authorship of shared
information resources. It is a term that could apply to several people working
on a paper together, hundreds of people developing a complicated computer
program, thousands of people writing Wikipedia, or millions of people producing
and improving complex knowledge systems with impressive names like "modern
science" (or even "the state of human knowledge").

Without hoping to explain the complex and varied social phenomena that go on in
commons-based peer production, in this paper we pursue the more modest goal of
understanding the technical aspects of writing-in-common. We begin with a simple
model: that of text and commentary -- and commentary on that commentary -- and
so on.  This scholia-based model emphasizes /ownership of speech/ and
/freedom of speech/. We then consider what happens when the /freedom to
create derivative versions/ is added to the mix. The resulting model proves to
be quite sophisticated, and flexible enough to describe many different
commons-based peer production systems.

We provide an overview of our implementation of this model and describe several
popular existing systems in terms of the model. We discuss further experiments
with the model, and based on these investigations, suggest certain deployment
strategies which seem to offer some advantages over other commons-based peer
production systems. Finally, we investigate the implications our model has for
distributed authorship and writing-partly-in-common.

**  Program Insert

We describe a contemporary hypertext model, with classical roots, designed to
balance the interests of subjectivity and freedom of speech with the interests
of intersubjectivity and the growth of human knowledge. This presentation will
be of interest to document creators and persons seeking to add value to existing
texts.

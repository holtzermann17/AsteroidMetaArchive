Links to pages for bugs in the current implementations of the [[file:Projects.org][Projects]] we're
talking about on this wiki should be posted here (and perhaps elsewhere as
well).  If you are working on fixing a bug, link to it from your
[http://oddwiki.taoriver.net/wiki.pl/AsteroidMeta/Users user page].  If the bug
is huge, maybe it should be classified as a [[file:Tasks|Task.org][Tasks|Task]] instead.
If a bug has been fixed, move it to the [[file:Case Closed.org][Case Closed]] page.  Also note that we
have a /separate/ page for [[file:Feature Requests.org][Feature Requests]].  If you know what you're
doing and you think it is /worth/ doing, feel free to reclassify the bugs as
appropriate (i.e. move them to below a different project heading).

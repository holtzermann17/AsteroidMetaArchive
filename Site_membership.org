People should be able to pay money and become a "member" of PM.  We could give
free memberships to people who earn over say 10000 points in the course of their
editing activities.  Members would have certain perks (for example, see 
[[file:Create a question-answering system like Google Answers.org][Create a question-answering system like Google Answers]]).  If enough users
became members, this would generate revenue for the site. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

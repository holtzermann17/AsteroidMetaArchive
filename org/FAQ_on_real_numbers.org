This list is meant to collect a FAQ on real numbers. I am 
not sure if there are enough questions to motivate a FAQ entry
on PM. Hence this survey first.

* What is 0^0?

See [http://planetmath.org/?op=getmsg&id=9781 this thread].

* Why is (-1)(-1) equal to 1?

How does one explain this in intuitive terms?

* How does 0.99999.. and 1.0000.. differ?
See

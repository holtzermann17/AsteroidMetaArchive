Using the autogenerated [[file:FEM.org][FEM]] headers and some common sense,
build some shared style files for [[file:PM.org][PM]].  There will have to
be a system installed in PM/[[file:Noosphere.org][Noosphere]] to make these headers
work.


: See [[file:Headers and style files.org][Headers and style files]] for some work that's been done on this. --[[file:jcorneli.org][jcorneli]]

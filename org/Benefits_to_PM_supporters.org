For organizations like Wikipedia or the MAA or AMS, getting listed as a sponsor
would help increase awareness of the organization and what it is about.

We should always be careful of funding that comes with strings attached - but I
think we're likely to be pretty safe if we work with scholarly societies.  Their
"strings" might be somewhat interesting to explore, anyway.

You're absolutely right about the "strings".  I'm always calculating what
the potential strings might be when I'm considering any sponsorship arrangement with
any official organization (profit or nonprofit).  But I feel somewhat safe, because 
of the organizational structure of PlanetMath, which has a board of directors that 
vett all major decisions.  David Jao, in particular, is very shrewd.

Oh, and alozano is starting a short MAA article for PM!

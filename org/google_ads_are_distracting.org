Here I will raise a small complaint against the Google !AdSense ads.

They are distracting!  How do I know?  I look at them!  I /know/ that wasn't
what I came to !PlanetMath to read.

Granted, I don't look at them when I browse PM with Lynx (which is nice) but I
also worry about other people who might find the ads distracting.

More generally, I think think we should offer a version of the site with a
visual profile that has been simplified as much as possible.  No logos,
sidebars, adds, etc.  Each page does exactly what it is supposed to do, with
minimal links to other pages.  We could call it "PM lite" (or nitelite, I guess,
ha ha).  See also [[file:Text-only webpage.org][Text-only webpage]], but note that the "lite" version of
the page could be graphical.

Personally, I don't find the ads at all distracting.  I think they are 
out-of-the way, and low-key.  If we can find a funding source that dwarfs
the ads (which we'll have to do as a 501(c)3), it would of course make sense
to discontinue them.

It seems to me to make sense to offer the removal of ads when logged-in as 
one of the major perks of becoming a member of the nonprofit.

I think the "lite" version is a really interesting idea, though.  --[[file:akrowne.org][akrowne]] Sat Apr 16 17:36:04 UTC 2005

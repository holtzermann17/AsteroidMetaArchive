It would probably be a good idea to link the Ubuntu literature,
particularly where they talk about "be collaborative".

I don't think it necessarily would work at [[file:http://www.firstmonday.org/guidelines.html first monday.org][http://www.firstmonday.org/guidelines.html first monday]],
but it might be interesting to consider presenting this document as a "true hypertext",
choose-your-own-adventure kind of thing, with suitable links between different sections.

However, (typically) that only takes it further away from the "respectable publication quality"
article domain we're shooting for.

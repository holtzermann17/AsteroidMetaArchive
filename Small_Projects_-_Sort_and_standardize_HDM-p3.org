There are already 100 definitions in something similar to hcode
written down in HDM-p3.  Someone could sort these definitions
into [[file:Hcode libraries.org][Hcode libraries]], and in the process check that they match
the [[file:Version Zero.org][Version Zero]] language standard.  Sometimes the standard may
have to be expanded upon; this is a good chance to think about how to
make the /language extensible/.

At least a little work on this project may be a good warm-up for other
porting projects (e.g. porting metamath or p2/APM-xi).
